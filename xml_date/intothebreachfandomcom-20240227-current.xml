{{Tile infobox

}}
The '''A.C.I.D. Pool Tile''' is one of the [[Tiles]] in [[Into The Breach]].

==Notes==
Any unit that stops on this tile will be inflicted with [[A.C.I.D.]], including flying units.  Units can safely walk across the pool without effect however.

Any unit inflicted with A.C.I.D. that dies on a [[Ground Tile]] will turn the tile into an A.C.I.D. Pool.

At the start of a mission, mechs cannot be deployed to A.C.I.D. Pool Tiles, even if the mech's pilot provides immunity to A.C.I.D.

'''A.C.I.D. Projector''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into The Breach]]. It is the starting weapon of the [[Nano Mech]].

==Strategy==
Being able to apply A.C.I.D. to an enemy as needed is very useful for reducing the reliance of damage upgrades for the overall Squad. The target is also pushed with A.C.I.D. Projector, so the weapon can also be used to move away a Vek that is targeting a Grid Building or objective.

A.C.I.D. Projector synergizes well with the Hazardous Mechs, which the Nano Mech starts with, as it lets them stay online via enemy kills thanks to [[Viscera Nanobots]]. It can also be useful if picked up by other Mechs in damage focused squads; notably, the [[Defense Mech]] could swap it for [[Attraction Pulse]], to let the other two [[Zenith Guard]] Mechs deal more damage and consistently neutralize targets.

The A.C.I.D. Tank is one of the [[weapons#Deployables|deployable tanks]] in the game [[Into the Breach]]. It can be found in a [[Time Pod]] or as a Reputation reward.

==Description==
Deploy a Tank that can apply A.C.I.D. to targets. Single-use.

The A.C.I.D. Tank starts with 1 HP and 3 move points.

===Class===
Any.

===Upgrades===
* '''+2 Health''' (1 Reactor Core {{template:1power}}) - Increases the Tank's max health to 3.
* '''Push''' (1 Reactor Core {{template:1power}}) - The Tank's attack also pushes its target.

==Strategy==
All four of the tank-as-weapon variants are limited to 3 movement, and are generally much weaker than a Mech. However, they can offer a crucial 4th action per turn, along with another unit to bait enemy Vek into attacking instead of Grid Buildings.

On harder difficulty levels, the major challenge is finding a turn has enough slack to deploy the tank rather than using the Mech's (typically more powerful) primary weapon. Once the Tank is out, subsequent turns become much easier.

The A.C.I.D. Tank can be helpful for decreasing the Squads reliance on damage upgrades, but its lack of initial displacement prevents it from reliably resolving targets until '''Push''' is powered (and is thus a recommended upgrade to get quickly).

'''Abe Isamu''' is a [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach''. 
==Location==
Abe Isamu can be acquired through pods and by completing islands 100%.

==Background==

Sometimes jokingly called "Honest Abe" in previous timelines, nothing could be farther from the truth. Abe served as an "expeditor" (assassin and "black box" work) during the early years of CEO Kern's rise to power, and he took on many names and identities in service to R.S.T. to handle any "difficult issues" that would arise that needed to be dealt with by the corporation. He is ruthless when given an objective (in this case, fighting the Vek), and served as ground support in his original timeline before stealing a Mech from a dying (?) pilot and using its breach technology to escape the timeline after the squad perished in the volcanic island. Since then, "Abe" has followed the orders of his first CEO Kern and is determined to keep fighting until every Vek in every timeline is defeated... a hopeless task, but "Abe" realizes he has little else to fight for, and even if he were to remain in a timeline he saved, he could not deal with the idea that other timelines were still in jeopardy. He has yet to encounter his duplicate, and if so, he may not recognize them due to surgery and the fluctuation of identities his job required before the Vek attack.

==Personality==
Stoic, calculating, cold. Soft spoken.

Abe seems to thrive on danger -- when his Mech is down to 1 HP, his eyes come alive and a smile plays across his face.

==Strategy==
With a single point of damage reduction, Abe is immune to one-damage attacks (including damage from the [[Psion Tyrant]]), making him an excellent hit sponge in the early game. Note however that Armor will not prevent spawn blocking damage, fire damage, explosive decay damage, or bump damage.

Abe's armor additionally allows him to use self-damaging weapons (such as the [[Charge Mech]]'s 'Ramming Engines') without penalty. Further, Abe's ability makes him a great candidate to pilot the [[Boulder Mech]] in the [[Blitzkrieg|'''Blitzkrieg''']] squad, as doing so allows the player to assemble longer chains along which to use the [[Electric Whip]] with lessened risk; especially if he has gained an inherent HP bonus through leveling.

Great care should be taken to avoid Abe's mech from being inflicted by A.C.I.D., which otherwise disables armor until the mech is repaired.

In the [[Steel Judoka|'''Steel Judoka''']] squad, he can make it significantly easier to get the [[Unbreakable]] achievement by letting him pilot the [[Gravity Mech]].

This page covers '''abilities''' and '''status effects''' from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
Abilities and status effects are conferred by equipment, pilot skills, or terrain. The below list contains all the possible effects that can affect a unit. Some are limited to Vek, others can only be used by [[mechs]].

==List of abilities==
* Energy Shield : Shields block damage and prevent new negative status effects (Fire, Freezing, A.C.I.D, etc.). Only direct damage will remove the Shield.
* Fire Immunity : This unit cannot be set on Fire.
* Flying : Flying units can be positioned at any terrain tile, except mountains. Mountains and unfriendly units can be overflown. Flying mechs cannot be waterlogged, and all flying units are not affected by lava or A.C.I.D. tiles, because they don't submerge. Flying units are not immune to A.C.I.D. pools, fire, or emerging Vek.
* Kickoff Boosters : +2 Move this turn.
* Natural Armor : Weapon damage to this unit is reduced by 1, including Psionic Tyrant's Hive Targeted ability. All other damage (Push, Blocking, Fire, etc.) is unaffected.
* Smoke Immunity : This unit is unaffected by Smoke. Note that an enemy unit with this special ability will still be damaged by electric smoke (for e.g., the ACID Storm Controller).
* Zoltan Shield : Same as a normal Shield, but regenerates at the start of every turn.

==List of status effects==
* A.C.I.D. : Weapon damage against this unit is doubled and Natural Armor is disabled. All other damage (Push, Blocking, Fire, etc.) is unaffected.  Repairing removes the effect.
* Boost : This unit's damage is increased by 1 on its next attack. Affects all targets of the attack, including self damage. Removed upon any ability use, including non-damaging abilities and repairing; repairing while Boosted will heal 2 points.
* Fire : Units on Fire take 1 damage at the start of every turn. Repairing removes the effect, so does ending a movement Submerged in Water or in Smoke. Flying units cannot submerge in Water.
* Frozen : Units that are frozen are unable to move or attack, but can free themselves by repairing. Any damage to a frozen unit is negated, but will free the unit.
* Not Powered : Units without power are inactive and cannot move or attack, but still block reinforcements on their tile.
* Webbed : Units webbed by the Vek cannot move, but they can still attack.

==List of terrain effects==
* Electric Smoke : Units in Smoke cannot attack or repair. Electricity damages enemy units.
* Forest Fire : Unit is inflicted with Fire.
* Smoke : Units in Smoke cannot attack or repair. 
* Submerged : Weapons do not work when submerged in Water.
* Submerged in A.C.I.D. : Weapons do not work and the submerged Mech is inflicted with A.C.I.D.
* Submerged in Lava : Weapons do not work and the submerged Mech is inflicted with Fire.

==List of Vek abilities==
* Alpha Unit : Alpha units are more powerful than their standard counterparts
* Burrower : This Vek will hide underground after taking one or more damage.
* Explosive Decay : Explodes on death, dealing 1 damage to adjacent tiles. This damage ignores Armor!
* Flying : See [[#List of abilities|List of abilities]] section.
* Hardened Carapace : The Shell Psion is providing Armor to all Vek, reducing incoming weapon damage by 1. All other damage (Push, Blocking, Fire, etc.) is unaffected.
* Hive Leader : These are the most powerful Vek. Immune to water, they can be more challenging to kill.
* Hive Targeted : The Psion Tyrant will do 1 damage all friendly units every turn.
* Invigorating Spores : The Soldier Psion is providing +1 HP to all Vek.
* Massive : Massive units can walk in Water (but Water will prevent shooting).
* Overpowered : The Psion Abomination is enhancing all Vek. They gain +1 HP, regeneration, and explode on death.
* Regeneration : The Blood Psion is healing all Vek 1 point every turn.
* Self-Repairing : If damaged, this unit will Shield itself and prepare to heal.
* Stable : Cannot be moved by any weapon effect (Push, Teleport, etc.).

==Trivia==
* Interestingly, setting fire to [[Civilian Building]] tiles does not damage your Power Grid.

==Strategy==
* Killing an opponent with Explosive Decay near a building will damage the building, but there is a chance based on [[Grid Power|Grid Defense]] that the building will resist damage.  Therefore, the Reset Turn ability can be useful here to "try again" on exploding with a more favorable result.

}}'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach Advanced Edition''.
==Location==
Can be acquired by completing islands.
==Background==
==Personality==
==Strategy==
Adam's Chosen One special only activates when [[Reset Turn]] is used, but note that the +2 movement buff is only active for the turn that was reset. Only the [[shield]] gained will persist for the following turns until it is removed.

Chosen One effectively makes the Reset Turn button a hidden ace that can be used to try a new, previously impossible strategy. Examples include blocking with 1HP, using the shield to prevent status effects such as Acid, or reach an enemy that was previously too far away. Conversely, Chosen One can also be purposely activated to assist the players strategy; this does require purposely using the reset though.

It is possible to activate Adam's special twice per battle if paired with [[Isaac Jones]]'s Temporal Reset special ability, which grants a second reset turn per battle.

==Major additions==
* 5 new [[squads]] and 15 new squad [[achievements]].
* 7 new [[Vek]], 3 new Psions, and 10 new boss battles.
* 12 new [[Missions|mission types]] and 3 new bonus mission goals.

* Even more challenging difficulty mode, Unfair Mode!
* 7 New Languages! (Arabic, Thai, Swedish, Korean, Traditional Chinese, Turkish, and Latin American Spanish)
==Other changes==
*Optional Content Toggles - All of the new content (enemies, pilot skills, etc) other than balance changes are possible to turn off if you would like the base-game content experience.
* Weapon reactor usage reduced for most weapons - To allow for more experimenting.
*Store Changes - Since you can now instantly equip most weapons without needing an additional reactor core, the reputation cost to purchase weapons has increased by 1 and the store options are limited in the first 2 islands.

'''Aegis Mech''' is a Prime-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Frozen Titans]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Aegis Mech is one of the few Prime Mechs that starts with 4 move points, and its sturdy 3HP lets it effectively move through the front lines. Its default weapon '''Spartan Shield''' allows the Aegis Mech to redirect an enemy's attack in the opposite direction, which is helpful in resolving situations where multiple buildings in a row or column would otherwise be at risk.

While not a high-damage dealing weapon, Spartan Shield does have relatively cheap upgrades. The '''Gain Shield''' upgrade is self explanatory and the bigger priority to power, letting it use the shield to sit on a spawn point, take bump damage (from the [[Mirror Mech]] pushing an enemy into it for e.g.) or body block damage if needed.

Despite this, it is not very effective at resolving targets that move themselves with their attacks, such as [[Moth|Moths]] and [[Bouncer|Bouncers]], and it struggles with enemies that hit in multiple directions, such as the [[Firefly Leader]]; while the shield will keep the Aegis Mech safe, all these enemies can still damage the grid even when hit by it. Thus, it is recommended to look for another weapon that offers displacement.

The '''Aegon Mortar''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into the Breach]].

==Description==
Deals damage to two tiles, pushing one forwards and one backwards.

Deals 1 damage to the target.
===Class===
Ranged.
===Upgrades===
* +1 Damage {{Template:1power}}
* +1 Damage {{Template:2power}}

==Strategy==
Aegon Mortar has low damage to start, but can target 2 tiles that pulls the first target and pushes the second; this makes it a decent, albeit situational option for Ranged Mechs that lack displacement such as the [[Ice Mech]]. The pushing angles are beneficial in situations with high enemy numbers clustered together to spread bump damage, or in specific maps where lakes are present in the middle to drown land Vek. However, they can also be detrimental in tight spaces, particularly pulling or pushing enemies into nearby objectives and buildings.

The '''Aerial Bombs''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into the Breach]]. It is the starting weapon of the [[Jet Mech]].

==Description==
Fly over a target, dropping an explosive smoke bomb.

Deals 1 damage to the target. The Mech ''must'' have an empty tile to land on the opposite side of the target to land on; it will not be able to fire otherwise.

===Class===
Brute.

===Upgrades===
* '''+1 Damage''' (2 Reactor Cores {{Template:2power}}) - Increases damage by 1.
* '''+1 Range''' (2 Reactor Cores {{Template:2power}}) - Allows jumping over and attacking an additional target.

==Strategy==
Aerial Bombs is the main method to lay down Smoke for the [[Rusting Hulks]], offering decent damage and utility; it deals 1 damage directly + 1 damage from [[Storm Generator|Electric Smoke]] at the start, along with cancelling out the targets attack and preventing enemies from attacking in that tile in future turns. Since the attack lets the Mech jump over the enemy, it can also be useful to escape webbing by itself.

However, the weapon needs to have an unoccupied tile on the other side of the target to land on. Otherwise, the weapon is completely unable to fire. The '''+1 Range''' is recommended to get first with it for this reason, as it will give the Mech more flexibility on where it can use the weapon. This also means that some missions, such as '''Destroy the [[Old Earth Dam|Dam]]''', will be impossible to fulfill with it.

It's also possible to cut-off attack angles if too much Smoke is laid haphazardly; Mechs themselves also can't attack in Smoke, unless they are paired with an immunity to smoke. Additionally, the damage is very underwhelming without Electric Smoke. Thus, it is recommended to look for a secondary weapon that can attack its target directly without positional constraints, or to have the Mech using the weapon be piloted by [[Camila Vera]].

Some [[Missions]] have additional units available, and successful completion of those missions often involve protecting those units. 
* "Active" allied units behave the same as units in the [[Squads|squad]]; each turn the player can choose their movement and/or attack.
* "Passive" allied units also exist but can't be directly interacted with. Some Passive Allied units must be destroyed to fulfill the mission bonus objective; an example being the Old Earth Dam.

Both the above allow passing-through movement of squad/allied units.

'''Alpha Beetle''' is one of the Alpha [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
The Alpha Beetle charges forward in a line, dealing 3 damage and pushing the first target it hits.

==Strategy==
Much like the standard [[Beetle]] but with more health and damage, the Alpha Beetle charges until it runs into an obstacle, doing damage to its target. This ability can cause the Alpha Beetle to dash itself into a body of water, a chasm, an A.C.I.D. pool, or lava.

Alternatively, if the Alpha Beetle is first in the attack order, try to displace them so that they target another enemy; since they damage ''AND'' push their target, look for opportunities where they can provide bump damage, push grounded enemies into water, or push another enemy away from a building.

'''Alpha Blob''' is both one of the Minor [[Vek]] and the Alpha Vek from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.
==Description==
The Alpha Blob is spawned by the [[Alpha Blobber]]'s Volatile Growths system. On the Blob's turn, it explodes, dealing 3 damage to all tiles adjacent to it. If the Blob is destroyed before its turn by damaging it or displacing it into a hazardous tile such as water, or if it's smoked or frozen, it will not explode.
==Strategy==
Blobs are not affected by the [[Blast Psion]]'s Explosive Decay ability and can be destroyed safely in close proximity to Grid/objective buildings.

Like other attacks, smoke and freeze will stop the Blob from using its "explosion" ability on its turn.

'''Alpha Blobber''' is one of the Alpha [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
The Alpha Blobber maintains a safe distance from mechs, attempting to attack by spawning [[Alpha Blob|Alpha Blobs]] onto any tile across from them, in the row or columns they can move in. Alpha Blobs always explode last in the attack order during the enemy turn they were spawned, and damage all adjacent tiles for 2.

Alpha Blobbers are capped at one spawn per mission (regular Blobbers included) and cannot spawn on island 1, nor can it co-exist with the normal and alpha variants of the [[Spider]] and [[Plasmodia]].

==Strategy==
The strategy to deal with Alpha Blobbers is identical to dealing with [[Blobber#Strategy|Blobbers]].

}}The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a common [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the Advanced Edition. They are only present if Advanced Enemies are turned on at the start of a new timeline.
==Description==
Bouncers attack one tile in front of them, much like a [[Hornet]] without flight. What differentiates the Bouncer is that it will push the target tile and push themselves back by 1 tile, potentially resulting in a chain of collisions.
==Strategy==
Much like standard [[Bouncer#Strategy|Bouncers]], Alpha Bouncers are easy to deal with in open spaces, as they can be pushed away from targets much like a [[Scorpion]]. However, the two-directional push must be considered as it could lead to further damage on grid buildings; this can be used to your advantage by directing the backwards push into a mountain or water tiles. In the latter, they will instantly drown and be destroyed.{{Vek}}

'''Alpha Burrower''' is one of the Alpha [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
Alpha Burrowers move underground to arrive at their destination and bypass any obstacles, much like a [[Leaper]] minus the jumping. When emerging they attack a 3-tile wide area in front of them perpendicular to where they are facing. Upon taking any damage, they will cancel their attack and retreat underground, re-emerging elsewhere (within 4 tiles of where they retreated from) on their next turn. Alpha Burrowers can not end their move on top of [[Ice Tile|Ice Tiles]].

Alpha Burrowers are '''Stable''' and thus cannot be pushed or moved with physical force, however they can still be relocated by the [[Control Mech|Control Mech's]] Control Shot weapon.

As rare enemies, Alpha Burrowers cannot appear on the first island and are limited to two spawns per mission.

==Strategy==
Use the same strategy as for fighting [[Burrower#Strategy|Burrowers]], though Alpha Burrowers having 5HP does make them a lot sturdier. Try to bump other enemies into them if you cannot take them down with one strong hit, as they will still retreat from any kind of damage, and block enemy spawns to prevent being overwhelmed the next turn by the Alpha Burrower emerging back.

'''Alpha Centipede''' is one of the Alpha [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
The Alpha Centipede shares the movement and health of the [[Alpha Firefly]], but is armed with an acidic attack that applies [[A.C.I.D.]] to the targeted tile and the two tiles perpendicular to the direction of the projectile.

Alpha Centipedes cannot appear on the first island and are limited to two spawns per mission.

==Strategy==
The strategy for fighting Alpha Centipedes is the same as regular [[Centipede#Strategy|Centipedes]]; try to displace them so that they hit other enemies, and use their A.C.I.D. status to deal high damage to sturdy targets.

'''Alpha Crab''' is one of the Alpha [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
Alpha Crabs fire a [[Scarab]]-like artillery attack that reaches up to five tiles in range. The projectile damages both the tile it lands on and one tile in front of it. Despite being named after an aquatic animal, it is capable of drowning.

Alpha Crabs cannot appear on the first island and are limited to two spawns per mission. Alpha Crabs also cannot appear with Scarabs or [[Moth|Moths]].

==Strategy==
Alpha Crabs are more durable than the Alpha Scarab, but the strategy remains the same; if you cannot kill it, you push it away. The extra area from the projectile means pushing it away from the target is unsafe, but pushing it towards or to the side will usually be fine.

Though it is not shown in game, keep in mind that Alpha Crabs have a maximum 5-tile range. If possible to do so safely, pushing them towards the edges is encouraged, as it will force them to move forwards to target buildings at the other end of the map. The player can use this knowledge to their advantage by walling them out and limiting the possible targets that Alpha Crabs can hit, making their movements more predictable.

'''Alpha Digger''' is one of the Alpha [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
Before attacking, the Alpha Digger places a normal boulder on any empty adjacent tile. Alpha Diggers attack for 2 damage to all adjacent tiles, likely destroying the boulders in the process.

Alpha Diggers cannot appear on the first island and are limited to one spawn per mission.

==Strategy==
In contrast to regular [[Digger#Strategy|Diggers]], the Alpha Digger is much sturdier at 4HP and requires significant damage to fully destroy in one hit, even with ranged artillery weapons. The boulders it surrounds itself with can also be nuisance, as they not only protect the Alpha Digger, but can also block your grounded Mech's movements to reach other dangerous enemies. These traits make the Alpha Digger particularly dangerous, and should be a priority to neutralize.

That said, the same strategy with regular Diggers can be used when deploying against Alpha Diggers; try to bait them into attacking a high damage Mech with one space next to another target directly; this will not create a boulder beside your Mech and it will be free to attack the Alpha Digger. Pushing it into its own boulders is encouraged to maximize the damage dealt and destroy it in one hit. If it's not possible to bait the Alpha Digger during deployment, look to use weapons that can Smoke it or Freeze it, or wide range weapons like [[Wind Torrent]] that can move it away from targeted buildings safely.

It's worth putting off an island until later if you see Diggers, and you don't think your current squad's weapon loadout can neutralize them consistently.

'''Alpha Firefly''' is one of the Alpha [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
The Alpha Firefly shoots projectiles in a direct line, similar to the [[Taurus Cannon]] weapon without push. 

==Strategy==

The same strategy for the standard [[Firefly#Strategy|Firefly]] can be used to deal with the Alpha Firefly. They do have more health and deal more damage though, so blocking its projectile with your own Mechs is a lot more dangerous, likely fatal in the early-game on higher difficulties.

That said, if the Alpha Firefly goes early in the Attack Order, it can be pushed to force the projectile to take care of other enemies. Just like the standard Firefly, moving the Alpha or its target should still be done carefully, to avoid exposing Buildings to further danger.

}}The {{PAGENAME}} is a common Alpha [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the Advanced Edition. They are only present if Advanced Enemies are turned on at the start of a new timeline.
==Description==
Alpha Gastropods fire a grappling hook that deals 3 damage to the target and either pulls it to the Alpha Gastropod or the other way around, depending on if the target is immovable. If the hook does not hit anything, the Alpha Gastropod does not move. Despite being based off an aquatic animal, they are able to drown.

==Strategy==
Unlike the [[Alpha Firefly]], the Alpha Gastropod only has 4 health and is more brittle, but its higher movement (3 instead of 2) and projectile-based attack are still dangerous in the early game. However, Alpha Gastropods can pull other Vek away from targets and lack non-grappling movement, which can be used to your advantage in protecting objectives or the grid.

Much like regular [[Gastropod#Strategy|Gastropods]], the Alphas are also capable of pulling themselves towards solid structures, including [[Mountain Tile|Mountains]]. In particular, try and redirect their attack so that they pull themselves to a mountain located right next to a chasm or water tile, and they'll instantly be destroyed after attacking.

'''Alpha Hornet''' is one of the Alpha [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
The stronger variant of the regular [[Hornet]] with more health, damage and range. Flying mobility lets it move freely through mountains, cities and the players units. It cannot be drowned, so has to be killed through damage and damaging effects instead.

==Strategy==
The Alpha Hornet's ability to attack two tiles for two damage makes them a menace to the grid, possibly restricting the directions the player can safely displace them in. Combined with their very high movement of 5 tiles, they are very dangerous and should be killed at the earliest opportunity that is at all reasonable.

They have enough health to survive most un-upgraded attacks, and can take 2 actions in the early-game to eliminate entirely. Even in the late-game when the player can have access to attacks that do 4 base damage, their high mobility and flight lets them attack from water or pit tiles in tough angles, inaccessible corners, or restrict the players grounded Mechs from reaching other enemies.

On the initial deployment turn, deploying two of your Mechs in a line can sometimes bait Alpha Hornets to attack your mechs instead of cities, which gives more breathing room for the first turn. Although they can fly, they still can't occupy tiles your own units are occupying, so it can also be useful to deploy your own mechs / allied units inside corners, or next to the middle city of a line with 3 cities. Always have a plan for how to dislodge an Alpha Hornet from faraway cities or narrow passageways, tiles which would otherwise be very annoying for the Alpha Hornet to enter.

If looking to kill them, any kind of pre-emptive or additive damage to soften them up makes a huge difference - fire, bump damage from other attacks or your own Mechs, or enemy fire can score additional damage on them; look for [[Alpha Firefly|Alpha Fireflies]] and [[Alpha Beetle|Alpha Beetles]] to redirect and attack the Alpha Hornet. The [[Firefly Leader]] can do 4 damage too, killing them in one shot. Otherwise, attacks that both damage and move at the same time are essential for dealing with them, as are weapons that can either pull, teleport, or cancel the Alpha Hornet's attack entirely (such as freeze or smoke). Freezing them over water will not drown them as it will also create an ice tile, but shoving a frozen Alpha Hornet into the water will still drown it. Freezing an Alpha Hornet over pit will make it fall into the pit. Beware in the final mission, as you cannot freeze a Hornet flying above lava.

'''Alpha Leaper''' is one of the Alpha [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
Alpha Leapers jump to their destination and avoid all obstacles in the way. After they move they will web an adjacent target and prepare to stab it during the enemy turn for 5 damage.

Leapers cannot spawn alongside the [[Scorpion]].

==Strategy==
Strategy is identical to the standard [[Leaper]], except that its 3 health makes it more dangerous in the early phase of the game with less powerful Mechs in play. If there is an Alpha Leaper first in the attack order, look for situations where it can be displaced in such a way to hit other enemy Vek; with very high damage output of 5, the Alpha Leapers attack is strong enough to kill every non-Leader enemy.

The '''Alpha Mosquito''' is one of the Alpha [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the [[Advanced Edition]]. They are only present if Advanced Enemies are turned on at the start of a new timeline.

==Description==
As a flying enemy with 4 health, the Mosquito is similar to the [[Alpha Hornet]], trading 1 point of movement and the ability to attack 2 tiles for the ability to apply [[Smoke Tile|Smoke]] to the target tile and damage for three points.

Mosquitoes and their alpha variant cannot spawn on an island with any other flying Vek ([[Hornet]], [[Moth]]) other than the island's Psion.

==Strategy==
As smoke does not inhibit movement, it is often manageable just by moving away; however, smoke in a poor location can sometimes cause problems, and can be particularly dangerous in combination with webbing enemies. Unlike Alpha Hornets, Alpha Mosquitoes only hit a single tile at a time, which generally makes them less of a threat as they are easier to deal with by repositioning; nevertheless, they still have similarly high movement with flight, so they should be neutralized if they are starting to move too far away from your Mechs. Overall, Alpha Mosquitoes are among the less threatening Alpha Vek.

}}The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a flying [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the Advanced Edition. They are only present if Advanced Enemies are turned on at the start of a new timeline.
==Description==
The {{PAGENAME}} is a 5-health, 3-move flying Vek that fires an artillery attack much like the [[Scarab]], flying over any tiles to land on the target and deal 3 damage. This attack pushes the affected target and the Moth itself away by one tile.

Alpha Moths cannot spawn on an island with any other flying Vek (Hornet, [[Mosquito]]) other than the island's Psion. In addition, they also cannot spawn with either Scarabs or [[Crab|Crabs]].
==Strategy==
The Alpha Moth is the most dangerous of the common flying Veks, and arguably the most dangerous common Alpha enemy. In tight spaces, it is very likely to be knocked back into a building, dealing heavy damage to your grid. With 5HP, it is also a very sturdy enemy, and its flight lets it pass through your Mechs and get into tight corners more easily. Like the regular Moth, its weakness is its low movement, so deploy your Mechs to block them from reaching difficult spots whenever possible. Similarly, pushing it into tiles where they can be recoiled into other Vek is a great way of using its attack to your advantage, especially with [[Force Amp]].

== Trivia ==

* Moths were previously able to spawn alongside Scarabs and Crabs. This is no longer the case as of version 1.2.76b.

}}The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a rare alpha [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the Advanced Edition. They are only present if Advanced Enemies are turned on at the start of a new timeline.
==Description==
Much like the [[Blobber]] and [[Spider]], the Alpha Plasmodia is a slow-moving spawner Vek that fires an [[Alpha Spore]] using artillery range. The Spore destroys itself during the enemy turn to shoot a pushing projectile for 3 damage at a certain direction.

As a rare Vek, Alpha Plasmodia cannot spawn on the first island and are limited to one spawn per mission. Alpha Plasmodia also cannot spawn with either Blobbers, Spiders, the [[Blobber Leader]], [[Spider Leader]] or [[Plasmodia Leader]].

==Strategy==
Much like the standard [[Plasmodia#Strategy|Plasmodia]], the Alpha Plasmodia is easier to deal with compared to the other two notorious spawner Vek. The same strategy can be used as with the standard Plasmodia.

== Trivia ==

* Before version 1.2.76b, the Plasmodia had no restrictions on spawning outside of the usual caps set for rare Vek, meaning that it could spawn with other spawning Vek and the Spider Leader.

'''Alpha Scarab''' is one of the Alpha [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
Alpha Scarabs are shaped like soft-shelled beetles. They attack similarly to artillery style Mech weapons. Alpha Scarabs will aim in a straight line at a tile and shoot over any tiles in between them and their target.

==Strategy==
Much like the standard [[Scarab#Strategy|Scarab]], the Alpha Scarab can usually be neutralized with one action by shoving it away from its target, due to its one-tile range. They do have more health points however, so in higher difficulties they will require more actions to take out.

'''Alpha Scorpion''' is one of the Alpha [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
The Alpha Scorpion resembles the creature it is named after, stinger included. Its goal is to restrict units' mobility with webbing, then attack them.

==Strategy==
Much like the standard [[Scorpion]], the Alpha Scorpion has high health but low mobility. Try to deploy your Mechs with weapons that can free themselves near it, or otherwise keep them away from the Alpha Scorpion's movement range so it instead targets an already stationary building or objective. The Alpha Scorpion is one of the sturdier enemies at 5 health, so it's recommended to use bump damage and displaced enemy attacks to wear it down.

'''Alpha Spider''' is one of the Alpha [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
Alpha Spiders have very limited movement, but have the unique ability of throwing a [[Spiderling Egg]] on any column or row they are aligned with. This egg traps all surrounding entities in webs upon landing and will hatch into a [[Spiderling]] on the next turn. The Spiderling's stats from the Alpha Spider are identical to that of the regular [[Spider|Spiders]].

As a rare Vek, Alpha Spiders cannot spawn on the first island are are limited to one spawn per mission.

==Strategy==
With 4HP, Alpha Spiders are sturdier than regular [[Spider#Strategy|Spiders]] and require more damage to take out. Still, dealing them is similar to the regular Spider; try to deploy your Mechs so that at most only one of them is webbed, then take out or wear down the Alpha Spider with ranged weapons, or wide area targeting weapons that can damage both the sticky egg and the Alpha Spider. If you cannot take it out in one strong hit, look to push it so that it falls on water or blocks an enemy [[Spawn Tile|spawn point]].

}}The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a rare Alpha [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the [[Advanced Edition]]. They can only be encountered if advanced enemies are turned on at the start of a new timeline.
==Description==
{{PAGENAME}} attack by striking the four corner tiles around them, much like a grounded 4-way [[Hornet]]. Despite being based off an aquatic creature they are capable of drowning.

As a rare Vek, Starfish cannot spawn on the first island are are limited to a number of spawns per mission, depending on the number of [[Islands]] completed.
==Strategy==
The Alpha Starfish is more dangerous than the regular [[Starfish#Strategy|Starfish]], as its sturdier health makes it tougher to take down in one hit. It can be a problem in maps with buildings lined up in particular, as it is can't be safely pushed to the sides and is harder to kill with one hit. In maps with more open spaces however, it is easy to push it away. Since it attacks multiple tiles, it is also reliable to bait it during deployment with two of your Mechs. The tiles it targets at a diagonal can also be used to kill multiple weakened enemies if they go early in the Attack Order.

}}The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a rare Alpha [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the Advanced Edition. They are only present if Advanced Enemies are turned on at the start of a new timeline.
==Description==
The {{PAGENAME}} attacks by summoning an [[Unstable Boulder]] and threatening to destroy it with a 3 damage attack, causing the boulder to inflict 1 damage to adjacent tiles (including the Tumblebug). These boulders do not explode if they are not damaged. If an {{PAGENAME}} is forced to attack an object or unit directly it will not summon an unstable boulder.

As a rare Vek, Tumblebugs cannot appear on the first island and are restricted to two spawns per mission. They cannot spawn on missions with [[Old Earth Mine|explosive mines]].
==Strategy==
Strategy is the same as [[Tumblebug#Strategy|Tumblebugs]], except Alpha Tumblebugs have 5HP and are harder to take down. Do also note that their Unstable Boulders still only deal 1 damage when they explode; only the Alpha Tumblebug's direct attack deals more damage (3) than that of the regular Tumblebug (1).

}}The '''Arachnid Psion''' is one of the [[Vek]] psions from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the Advanced Edition. They are only present if Advanced Enemies are turned on at the start of a new timeline.
==Description==
Arachnid Psions are identifiable by their squid-like cyan body and pink bumps. While alive, they grant all other Vek except for any [[Blob|Blobs]], [[Spore|Spores]], [[Spiderling|Spiderlings]] and [[Spiderling Egg|Spiderling Eggs]] the ability to spawn a Spiderling Egg on death. The Spiderling Egg matches those that spawn from the [[Spider Leader]] and does not web surrounding tiles. These eggs spawn even if the vek falls into water or a bottomless pit, with the egg flying out of the body of water or hole and landing on a nearby land tile.

Psions can only spawn once per mission. The [[Psionic Receiver]] will force disabled Mechs to spawn enemy Spiderling Eggs, so it has no direct benefit to the player.&lt;ref&gt;[https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/417652043558420481/1000266345163784262/unknown.png?ex=65a21920&amp;is=658fa420&amp;hm=38f9e62d84a9e630745108915aae97621556b7b5439e00109769fce4ec2444c0&amp;=&amp;format=webp&amp;quality=lossless&amp;width=917&amp;height=538], psionic receiver spawning an egg from a disabled mech&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy==
While the spiderling eggs are of no direct harm, they can be nuisance when spawned from many defeated enemies as they can block grounded Mech movement. Additionally, multiple [[Spiderling|spiderlings]] in the next enemy movement turn can quickly overwhelm the Grid if they are allowed to spread out. Thus, it is recommended to kill the Arachnid Psion as early as possible.

If taking out the Arachnid Psion is not possible due to other enemies threatening the grid, look for ways to displace enemies without killing them. Or alternatively, enemies can be killed on top of hazardous tiles including Fire, Electric Smoke, incoming Vek spawns, or environmental hazards such as Lightning Strikes; the incoming damage will immediately dispose of the Spiderling Egg.

Of note, squads that are effective at countering the Arachnid Psion are those which have access to passive damaging effects and wide area targeting weapons. These include [[Blitzkrieg]] with Lightning Whip, [[Flame Behemoths]] to create fire and [[Rusting Hulks]] with electric smoke. [[Missile Barrage]] is also a very effective weapon at defeating multiple spiderlings.

==Trivia==
Before version 1.2.82, Vek that fell into liquid or chasm tiles could spawn their flying spider egg on top of time pods, crushing it in the process.

'''Arachnoid Mech''' is a Ranged-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Arachnophiles]] squad.
==Strategy==
Compared to other Ranged mechs such the [[Artillery Mech]], the Arachnoid Mech does not have an immediate push with its default weapon. Instead, the Arachnoid Injector is a low-damage weapon that hits a single target, and demands killing an enemy to spawn an Arachnoid unit; this friendly spider-like unit can then be used to push another target. Functionally, the spawned Arachnoid can be seen as a very flexible push that can be banked for later turns if it isn't needed immediately.

The spawned Arachnoid unit has 1 health, 3 movement, and a melee attack which does 1 damage, pushes away, and kills the Arachnoid. Unlike the [[Bombling Mech]]'s bombs, Arachnoids only dismantle after attacking and not at the end of the turn. Unless the player has a clear advantage, using them to block spawns should be avoided if there are more than 2 turns remaining, as their value tends to be higher than a single spawn block. Other effective uses of Arachnoids include blocking movement of grounded enemies, using them to bait enemies into attacking them, moving them to collect time pods, or enabling a ricochet from the [[Bulk Mech]] in the Arachnophiles squad.

The health, movement and damage for the friendly Arachnoid units is not affected by upgrades to the Arachnoid Mech itself; but the Arachnoid can gain A.C.I.D. to its attack if the '''Acidic''' upgrade is powered for the Arachnoid Injector weapon. An Arachnoid that spawns from an enemy inflicted with A.C.I.D will absorb the [[A.C.I.D. Pool]]; when the same Arachnoid self-destructs after attacking, it will similarly leave an A.C.I.D. pool in that tile. However, beware of any other environmental effects when killing enemies, such as cracking a tile with the damage, killing flying enemies over chasms and water, or enemies exploding when defeated under the [[Blast Psion]]'s explosive decay; under these conditions, the Arachnoid will instantly be destroyed after spawning.

Going for either the Acidic or '''+1 damage''' upgrade first is preference dependent, though both should be considered high-priority upgrades as they both help the Arachnoid Mech's lackluster damage output. Being able to secure kills – against Psions in particular with increased damage – is critical for this Mech to function. Pilots with [[Boost]], such as [[Kai Miller]] or [[Morgan Lejeune]] (or anyone with the Opener skill) can help score kills too. Look to pick up a more conventional Ranged weapon with immediate push utility during the run, as the added flexibility can be useful when enemies get higher HP and can't be taken out on the first turn.

If using the Arachnoid Mech under a [[Custom Squad]], it is recommended to pair it with Mechs that can soften enemies for it to finish them off. Additionally, the [[Boulder Mech]] has unique synergy with it, as it is possible to also spawn Arachnoids from boulders; this can also alleviate [[Rock Accelerator|Rock Accelerator's]] 2-directional limited push, by letting the Arachnoid Mech target the leftover boulder and use the Arachnoid to push another nearby target.

The '''Arachnophiles''' are one of the [[Squads]] from [[Into The Breach]] added in the Advanced Edition. They consist of the [[Bulk Mech]], [[Arachnoid Mech]] and [[Slide Mech]] and are unlockable with four coins.

Arachnophiles rely on the Arachnoid Mech's Arachnoid Injector, an artillery weapon which creates an Arachnoid when killing an enemy. Arachnoids offer an extra layer of strategy to the squad as they can sacrifice themselves to damage and push enemies, allowing them to steamroll missions if they can be consistently spawned.

==Squad Achievements==
;[[Spider Breeding]]: Spawn 15 Arachnoids in one Island.
;[[Working Together]]: Area Shift 4 units at once.
;[[Efficient Explosives]]: Kill 3 Enemies with 1 shot of the Ricochet Rocket.

==Strategies==
*The Bulk Mech's ricochets are capable of dealing damage to multiple targets, both directly and through knock damage. The Slide Mech can be used to set up good ricochets.
* These ricochets often leave some targets at low health, which the Arachnoid Mech can take advantage of to score kills and spawn arachnoids. The arachnoids themselves can finish off low health targets as well.
* Unlike the [[Bombermechs]]' bombs, Arachnoids are not temporary units and should be saved for later turns if they are not needed. They are best used to get kills and handle threats that the mechs aren't capable of handling.
* While arachnoids can block spawns, they tend to be a little more valuable than a single spawn block. Given that newly spawned Vek will often target them and that they block enemy movement, their presence alone can help control the board; it's generally better to let things spawn and use the additional action granted by the arachnoids only when necessary.
*Pick an island with [[Leaper|Leapers]] first or choose [[Pinnacle Robotics]] as your first island. Leapers translate to a free Arachnoid and any Pinnacle mission where the bots are free to destroy also grants spiders, letting you steamroll missions without much issues.
*You can create Arachnoids from almost any unit, even other Arachnoids (but not from other Mechs). This can help your bots get into some really hard-to-reach places.
*Certain pilots work well in this squad:
**[[Kazaaakpleth]]: Grants the Slide Mech a decent attack which lets it become more useful early-game.
**[[Kai Miller]] and [[Morgan Lejeune]]: Boosting the Arachnoid Mech saves having to invest two cores into a damage upgrade, letting you insta-kill psions and generate spiders. Kai on the bulk mech also increases its firepower significantly but is vulnerable to losing the boost.
**[[Silica]]: Lets the Arachnoid Mech shoot twice, using the Slide Mech to make up for not moving.

'''Archimedes''' is a [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach''. 
==Location==
Archimedes can be acquired by completing islands.

==Background==
Archimedes is a cutting-edge robotic intelligence (a Sentient, he finds the term "robot" and "artificial" to be discriminatory) from Pinnacle designed to act as a Human Relations officer. It has come from a timeline where Pinnacle "oversaw" the islands (the Pinnacle Island Network: P.I.N.) and tended to the humans' needs (much like how you would take care of animals on a farm, but not in a mean or ruthless way – the Sentients simply saw themselves as benevolent caretakers to keep the humans from hurting themselves). 

Zenith has refused to allow Archimedes access to her network, for fear that his directives may corrupt programming on Pinnacle (if this occurred it would be inadvertent, but it is a possibility). Archimedes believes the rioting behavior of the robots on Pinnacle is due to either (1) a contradictory directive they are attempting to follow or reconcile, or (2) the possibility that the arrival of sentient pilot variants from other timelines may indeed be interfering with the natural programmatic order on the island.

==Personality==
Well-mannered, aristocratic, has a superiority complex (he comes from a more advanced timeline, he believes), and can be condescending toward humans.

==Strategy==
Archimedes has particular synergy with Teleport weapons that can cause other Pilots to sacrifice their own personal safety in order to rescue other Mechs from damage. Fire-and-Forget can also be used to reposition and intercept enemy attacks, collect Time Pods, or stand on enemy spawn points after having previously attacked a different target. The latter done best with an HP Mech upgrade, preferably in Armored and/or high-HP Mechs such as an upgraded [[Hook Mech]] or Prime-class Mechs.

'''Archive, Inc.''' is the first [[islands|island]] in the game [[Into the Breach]].  It is led by CEO [[Dewey Alms]] and has a Temperate environment.

Upon creation of a new save file Archive, Inc is always available.

==Map==
The Museum Island of Archive, Inc. is made up of 8 regions numbered 0 to 7. Region numbers are fixed, but region names are randomized. Ignore the colors on the map. The location of the Corporate HQ is always randomized. 

Missions can be attempted in 4 Regions before a Hive Leader attempts to destroy the Corporate HQ.

Regions must be unlocked by attempting to complete the objectives in an adjacent region. 

In the example map, Region 0 was the Corporate HQ. Regions 2 and 6 are unlocked because those regions are adjacent to the Corporate HQ. Selecting the mission in Region 2 unlocked Regions 1 and 3. The mission in Region 6 unlocked Region 4 and the mission in Region 4 unlocked Regions 5 and 7. Having attempted the missions in Regions 2, 6, 4 and 5, seismic activity by the Vek attacking the Corporate HQ destroys Regions 1, 3, and 7.

==Island-Specific Missions==
''Advanced Edition missions are only encounterable if "Advanced Missions" are on for a timeline.''

=== Reputation Objectives ===
* '''Defend the Artillery Support: 1 [[File:Icon stars.png]] Reputation'''
**An ally and player-controllable Artillery Support is present at the start of the mission. It has two health, one movement and attacks by targeting two tiles with artillery range.
*'''Destroy the Dam: 1 [[File:Icon stars.png]] Reputation'''
**A two-tile wide [[Old Earth Dam]] sits near a cluster of mountains. Destroying it converts a wide line of tiles into water, obstructing Vek movemen
*'''Defend the Train: 2 [[File:Icon stars.png]][[File:Icon stars.png]] Reputation'''
** A two-tile long [[Supply Train]] named Ol' Horace moves from one end of the map to another. If the train collides with anything or is damaged, it becomes a '''damaged train''' and one reputation point is lost. Damage it again and the train is destroyed entirely, yielding no reputation.
** Lasts 4 turns instead of 5.
** Also present on [[R.S.T. Corporation]] and [[Detritus Disposal]].
*'''Defend the Satellite Launches: 2 [[File:Icon stars.png]][[File:Icon stars.png]] Reputation, 1 for each satellite'''
**Two stationary satellites with 2 health each sit at random locations on the map. Every second player turn, one of them will prepare to launch, earning 1 reputation point and destroying anything next to it.
*'''Defend the Tank: 2 [[File:Icon stars.png]][[File:Icon stars.png]] Reputation, 1  for each tank'''
**Two inactive light tanks sit at random locations of the map. These light tanks have 1 health and can only push enemies. On the second-to-last turn each tank will activate if they survive.
*'''Defend the Armored Train (''Advanced Edition)'': 2 [[File:Icon stars.png]][[File:Icon stars.png]] Reputation'''
**Same conditions apply as the normal train mission except that Ol' Horace is armored and instantly kills anything it rams into without taking damage (unless it is a Mech).
** Exclusive to this island.
** Lasts 4 turns instead of 5.
*'''Use 3 Repair Platforms (''Advanced Edition)'': 1 [[File:Icon stars.png]][[File:Icon stars.png]] Reputation'''
**Mechs or ally units must use at least 3 repair platforms scattered across the map, which disappear and instantly restore units back to full health. Vek are also capable of using them.
**Always paired with the '''Bad Repairs''' environmental condition, which has Mechs start the mission with 1 health.
*'''End with 8 spaces on fire (''Advanced Edition)'': 2 [[File:Icon stars.png]][[File:Icon stars.png]] Reputation'''
**The map has a massive amount of forest tiles.
**1 reputation is awarded for partial completion of burning at least 4 tiles.

=== Environmental Conditions ===
* '''Air Support'''
**During the player turn a cross-shaped section of the map is marked for bombing. Before enemies attack, a group of Bombers will fly in and bomb all marked tiles, instantly killing [[File:Icon kill glow.png]] anything caught in the attack.
* '''Tidal Waves'''
**During the environment step the edge of the map will become water tiles, drowning any Vek standing on them.
**Cannot appear with any double-reputation objectives.
**Makes the mission last 4 turns instead of 5.
*'''Mines'''
**At the start of the mission the ground is littered with mines that instantly kill [[File:Icon kill glow.png]] anything that steps on them.
**The [[Blast Psion]] and [[Tumblebug|Tumblebugs]] of any variant are not allowed to spawn if this environmental condition is present.
*'''Bad Repairs (''Advanced Edition'')'''
**All Mechs start the mission with 1 health.
**Always paired with the '''Use 3 Repair Platforms''' objective.

'''Archive Inc Pilot''' is a [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach''. 
==Location==
Archive Inc Pilots are [[Archive, Inc.]] employees in the current timeline. They may appear in any unoccupied mechs upon starting a new game.

==Personality==
Archive Inc Pilots mention having signed up to Archive as historians, only later volunteering to pilot one of the squad's mechs. As such, they are a little uncertain, but still appear determined to defeat the Vek in order to save the timeline.

==Possible Names==
Archive Inc Pilots' names are made up of a given name (male or female) as well as a surname, both of which are randomly selected from the list below:{{template:PilotNames}}

==Strategy==
Archive Inc Pilots come without special skills, and only get randomized passive abilities. Due to this limitation, they can easily be outclassed by Time Travelers you encounter during your playthrough. Regardless, in most situations, having a CorPilot is still better than having no pilot at all. If they're not necessary anymore, Archive Inc Pilots can be traded in for a [[Corporate Reputation]] point after clearing any of the islands.

'''Ariadne''' is a secret [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach''.
==Location==
Found in '''Strange Pods''', which can be acquired by breaking [[Marked mountain tile|marked mountain or ice tiles]].

==Background==
Rock (people, male and females of the species exist) are large, herbivorous bipeds. Rock(men) are natural isolationists and like to be left alone. They are dogmatic and single-minded. In their own territories, they are largely religious zealots and have a wide interpretation of cultural transgression (ex: offers to trade can be interpreted as hostile). Rock(men) are raised so that radical members of their species are separated from the population and carefully managed so that they can fit in with the rest of their culture. Interaction with alien species is illegal. Their home culture involve arranged marriages. They were one of the founders of the Federation (along with humans and Engi). 

Rockmen who do not conform to their species stereotype (say, rebelling against religion or by being simply... different) can be found amongst the stars, and several instances of Rock pirates and warriors exist in the Big Black (they are known to cover their ships with "outcast decorations").  Ariadne (female of the species) was fleeing a pre-arranged marriage to a Basilisk Chief (see FTL) when the beacon diverted her vessel. Her crime prevents her from wanting to return to Rock space even if she could... but is uncomfortable amongst the many cultures on the new planet she has found. She is vaguely curious what time travel/breach technology could possibly do to erase her crime and the events leading up to it, allowing for a fresh start.

==Personality==
Rockmen "speech" is like a low grumble - slower, almost a 'rocks grinding' sound.

==Strategy==
Ariadne's greatest asset is her unrivaled boost to health by 3. This can make up for some Mechs' naturally low hit points — such as the [[Jet Mech]] or [[Control Mech]] — and bolster strategies that rely on tanking damage as with [[Blitzkrieg|'''Blitzkrieg''']]. The additional health is enough to bring any Mech to at least 5 HP, which allows her Mech to indefinitely block a Vek spawn with minimal need to repair.

In a similar vein to [[Abe Isamu]], the additional health is also beneficial with Mechs that wield self-damage weapons; the longest battles are 5 turns, but Ariadne boosting a mech to 6 health can survive all 5 turns using self-damage weapons without repairing, as long as she doesn't take any other kind of damage. This can be further aided by improving her mech's HP with one reactor core. The fire immunity is situational, but also allows Ariadne's Mech to take self-damage in a forest tile without suffering fire damage; most notably with the [[Charge Mech]] and the [[Leap Mech]].

== Trivia ==

* The +2 Mech Health and Skilled level up abilities are unobtainable by Ariadne.
* Before the [[Advanced Edition]], the player could run a risky strategy with Ariadne and the [[Flame Mech]], turning off the [[Flame Shielding]] passive and exploiting the additional power granted by it to increase the Flame Mech's range immediately. However, the passive no longer costs a Reactor Core to power as of the Advanced Edition, so this is no longer a possible strategy.

The '''Artemis Artillery''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into The Breach]]. It is the starting weapon of the [[Artillery Mech]].

==Description==
Powerful artillery strike, damaging a single tile and pushing adjacent tiles.

Deals 1 damage to the target.
===Class===
Ranged.
===Upgrades===
* '''Buildings Immune''' (1 Reactor Core {{template:1power}}) - This attack will no longer damage Grid Buildings.
* '''+2 Damage''' (3 Reactor Cores {{template:3power}}) - Increases damage by 2.
===Availability===

==Strategy==
Artemis Artillery provides multiple-target displacement with low damage, making it a basic but versatile weapon at resolving multiple threats in one area. The '''Building Immune''' upgrade is recommended first, as it can allow the Mech using it to target a building and push all adjacent enemies away, providing even better resolution value for one action; this is particularly useful in maps that have many buildings close together.

That said, the Reactor Core can also be swapped around to more Mech movement or vice-versa in the early-game, if the building immunity is not needed for maps with buildings spread out. Artemis Artillery can also be a good off-class weapon to equip for Mechs that lack utility.

'''Artificial Pilot''' is a [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach''. 
==Location==
All [[Mechs]] have an onboard Artificial Pilot. In the event a human or Pinnacle A.I. pilot is killed, the Artificial Pilot can operate the Mech until a replacement Pilot is found.

==Personality==
Artificial Pilots are assigned to mechs as a last resort in combat. While they are capable of fighting, Mechs excel and become better when manned by a human pilot (or Pinnacle A.I., which are far more advanced). Artificial Pilots are often present in the corporate islands, but not accorded the same status nor have the same extent of personality that the Pinnacle robots do.

==Strategy==
The easily replaceable AI pilot can be played far more recklessly than other pilots; if there is an opportunity to sacrifice an AI-controlled mech on the final turn to preserve grid power or complete an objective, do not hesitate to do so. Sacrificing your AI pilot before the final turn is far riskier, however.

Even if you have suitable generic pilots, it may be wise to leave highly self-destructive mechs in the AI’s control. Not only does this open up opportunities for riskier plays, but the unused pilots who are no longer at risk of dying can be traded for corporate reputation at the end of the island.

Because the AI cannot gain experience, it is slightly preferable to use it to soften a Vek before finishing it off with another pilot, if all other outcomes are equal.

'''Artillery-Bot''' is one of the  [[Sentient Weapons]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==

A cylindrical shaped quadreped robot carrying a missile launcher behind it.

==Strategy==

In general, the low health of Sentient Weapons makes them easy to take out with any attack or collateral damage from bumping [[Vek]] into them.

The challenging part comes when they must be kept alive in some objectives to claim reputation; in these cases, smoking or displacing them with non-damaging weapons is recommended, until they can be safely frozen. As their name implies, Artillery-Bots shoot lobbing projectiles in a 3-wide threat range, and can be difficult to fully negate grid damage without killing the Artillery-Bot. Smoke is particularly recommended if it can't be frozen immediately, otherwise it is recommended to freeze it at the earliest convenience.

'''Artillery Mech''' is a Ranged-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Rift Walkers]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Artillery Mech is best suited for long range combat and performs poorly at close range. Its Artemis Artillery cannon can hit enemies from across the map, which is useful for dealing with enemies that are out of range or behind obstacles such as mountains. It's a frail Mech to start, so it appreciates pilots with an ability that can bump its health up.

The pushing effect caused by its cannon can be used to push several enemies away and protect buildings; thus, it is recommended to unlock the '''Buildings Immune''' upgrade as early as possible, which allows the Artillery Mech to push all enemies adjacent to a building tile. The utility of pushing many enemies away often outweighs the damage done to enemies, particularly in higher difficulties. However, the additional '''+2 damage''' upgrade should be considered later in the run, especially if the next island has [[Digger|Diggers]] or the [[Shell Psion]]; the increased damage will allow the Artemis Cannon to dispatch these enemies more quickly.

== Types ==
There are several types of attack in Into the Breach. Usually they must be in targeted in cardinal directions from the unit attacking.

*'''Melee''': target immediately adjacent tile(s).
*'''Beam''': target all tiles in a line, until hitting a [[Civilian Building|Grid Building]], [[Mountain Tile|Mountain]] or [[Super Volcano]]. Beam attacks can deal damage that changes over distance (applying at least 1 damage) or apply other effects such as [[Fire]], [[Frozen|Freeze]] or pushing all affected targets.
*'''Projectile''': shoot in a straight line, hitting the nearest non-empty tile.
*'''Artillery''': target any one (sometimes two) tile in a line. Shell flies over high objects in an arc, but cannot target the tiles immediately adjacent. Enemy artillery attacks usually have a limited range of 5 tiles.
*'''Dash''': move in a straight line towards target. Usually combined with pushing the object on target tile.
*'''Fly Over''': move your unit over, targeting units under your trajectory.
*'''Free Aim''': target any tile(s) on the battlefield. This type of attacks is usually limited to [[Support Structure|Support Structures]] and certain limited-use weapons.

== Additional effects ==
Attacks can also have one or multiple additional effects:

* Pushing or pulling the target(s) in a cardinal direction (doesn't apply to immovable objects such as [[Civilian Building|Grid Building]] or Vek with [[Stable]] trait.
*Throwing the target.
*Swapping positions with the target.
* Applying [[Fire]], [[Frozen|Freeze]], [[A.C.I.D.]], [[Smoke]] or [[Shield]].
* Damaging self.
* Flipping target's attack direction (doesn't work on multi-directional attacks).</text>

==Strategy==
Attraction Pulse provides a basic pull, which can be handy to offer Mechs another displacement option. With the Defense Mech, it lets it pry enemies away from corners, something which the [[Zenith Guard]] squad can struggle with. It's also useful at pulling an enemy on a deadly tile, such as grounded Vek into a [[Water Tile]], or to pull the enemy into your own Mech for bump damage.

}}
'''Backup Batteries''' is one of the [[achievements]] in [[Into the Breach]].

==Notes==
This achievement can be done in conjunction with the [[Rusting Hulks]] squad, as they have a similar [[Overpowered]] achievement.

It's possible to get this achievement by completing objectives that reward Grid Power, accepting +2 Grid Power as the bonus reward (or +4 in Unfair difficulty), and then spending the remaining difference of reputation on Grid Power.

Additionally, it's possible to spend 10 reputation (or less pending the difference needed) on Grid Power to get the achievement, and then undo the reputation spent; since the achievement is awarded as soon as 10 Grid Power is earned in a single island, the player will still keep the achievement after selecting "undo all."

'''Beetle''' is one of the  [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
The Beetle charges forward in a line, dealing 1 damage and pushing the first target it hits. Its 4 health is the most of any non-Alpha Vek.

==Strategy==
A Beetle will die if its charge goes over any [[Water Tile]], [[Lava Tile]], [[A.C.I.D. Tile]], or [[Chasm Tile]]. You should encourage this behavior whenever possible, by either offering your Mechs as targets near a hazardous tile for them to charge to, or shove them so that they charge at one. Their high health can make it inefficient to dispose of them by other means.

Alternatively, if the Beetle is first in the attack order, try to displace them so that they target another enemy; since they damage ''AND'' push their target, look for opportunities where they can provide bump damage, push grounded enemies into water, or push another enemy away from a building. Just use caution to ensure they don't push an enemy into a building, as the bump damage will damage it even if their charge damage kills the enemy first.

'''Beetle Leader''' is one of the Boss [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
The Beetle Leader charges forward in a line, dealing 3 damage and pushing the target. It also lights every tile it passes through while charging on [[Fire]]; note that this not include the last tile it stops on. Despite this, the Beetle Leader is not immune to being set on fire, and will still take damage every turn if it is afflicted with fire. Because it is a '''Massive''' enemy, it's immune to being drowned, which means it can also put itself out of fire if it charges and stops at a [[Water Tile]] (but will still be on fire if it simply passes through one).

==Strategy==
This Vek will leave a trail of fire behind him when it charges. In some cases, it might be preferable to prevent that by putting an obstacle directly in front of it (such as knocking another Vek in front). However, Vek will avoid ending their movement on fire if they can help it; this means if the Beetle Leader is going to charge in front of a lot of your Grid buildings, the row of fire can inadvertently help protect your buildings from melee attacks.

Unlike [[Beetle|regular]] and [[Alpha Beetle|Alpha Beetles]], note that Beetle Leaders are capable of passing through Water/Lava/A.C.I.D squares undamaged, and will only die if they charge at a Chasm square.

'''Best of the Best''' is one of the [[achievements]] in [[Into the Breach]].

==Notes==
Not all three of the max level pilots need to be controlling a Mech; as long as the max level pilots aren't sold, it's enough for 2 max level pilots to be stored away when the third one reaches maximum level.

'''Bethany Jones''' is a [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach''. 
==Location==
{{PAGENAME}} can be acquired from pod drops.

==Background==
Bethany Jones [Pinnacle] 

Bethany Jones served as a physics engineer at Pinnacle, helping design and refine Pinnacle shield technology. Having only grown up on Pinnacle, she's somewhat sheltered with regards to the other islands, and she tends be too trusting of others, taking them at their word. She loves the cold and the snow, but she's also excited by the opportunities to see other islands in the Corporate archipelago and learn from the people there. While she and [[Isaac Jones]] are technically brother and sister, there hasn't been a timeline where they both were alive to realize this (Only one of them could have be saved in the womb because of a chronic medical condition their parents had). Bethany has had a more positive upbringing than Isaac, and her genius is tempered more with empathy and optimism than Isaac (who had a much more difficult childhood).

==Personality==
Caring, intelligent, pragmatic. A bit naive to war. Constantly hopeful &amp; encouraging. Looks for the best in humanity.

==Strategy==
Bethany Jones in the [[Ice Mech]] of the [[Frozen Titans]] will not freeze herself as long as her defense [[shield]] is still up.

'''Blast Psion''' is one of the  [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
The jellyfish-like Psions act as support units, providing passive bonuses to the [[Vek]]. The Blast Psion is distinguished by its light grey coloration and bright orange cranial nodes. This Psion's presence causes other Vek to explode upon death, damaging adjacent tiles. The ability granted to the other Vek is called [[File:Icon explode glow.png]] '''Explosive Decay'''.

The Blast Psion can never spawn on missions with [[Old Earth Mine|explosive mines]], even if they are the Psion for the [[Archive, Inc.]] island.

==Strategy==
The Blast Psion can complicate the resolution of any enemy on the map, as any enemy that dies will explode and deal collateral damage. If the Blast Psion can't be immediately taken out, look for weapons that can nullify other targets by either cancelling their attacks or pushing them away from buildings. It is possible to use the explosive decay effect to the players advantage to damage other Vek, provided caution is exercised in preventing collateral damage to the grid.

* Vek will not explode if Blast Psion also dies as part of the &lt;u&gt;same&lt;/u&gt; attack resolution. E.g. if you push a regular [[Leaper]] into a 1HP Blast Psion, the attack will kill them both and the Leaper won't explode. However, in sequenced deaths where Blast Psion dies as part of series of other deaths, explosions will continue to happen until Blast Psion dies as part of a ''separate'' attack resolution.&lt;ref name=blast_resolution&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/IntoTheBreach/comments/a6rmkd/media_one_shot_4_kills/ Blast Psion Resolution], notice the final Firefly enemy not exploding as it dies, since it was after the Blast Psion's death is processed.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vek explosions triggered by emerging Vek are processed after all Vek have finished emerging from underground. This may lead to unplanned outcomes when an explosive Vek dies due to blocking a [[Emerging|spawn point]] located adjacent to another spawn point. In this case, the Vek who emerges from the adjacent spawn point will be damaged by the explosion.&lt;ref name=blast_spawns&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/IntoTheBreach/comments/b6mddc/discussionpsa_blast_psion_explosions_are/ Explosions from Vek taking spawn block damage process after Vek have emerged]&lt;/ref&gt;
* If you kill a Vek with Explosive Decay by pushing it into a pit, the explosion will still damage adjacent tiles.

Blitzkrieg primarily relies on the Lightning Mech's extremely powerful Electric Whip, which can chain damage to targets and wipe out many enemies in a single attack. However, the whip is as dangerous to the enemy as it is to both your own mechs and mission objectives, meaning that the Hook and Boulder mechs are vital to position everything so that you deal the least collateral damage.

==Achievements==
;[[Chain Attack]]: Have the Chain Whip attack chain through 10 tiles
;[[Lightning War]]: Finish the first 2 Corporate Islands in under 30 minutes
;[[Hold the Line]]: Block 4 emerging Vek in a single turn

== Strategies ==
* There are often times where the Electric Whip must be chained with your own mechs to ensure the greatest damage; do not hesitate to do so if it can prevent grid damage and does not kill a pilot. This is dangerous early on when the Boulder Mech has only 2 HP and will be instantly killed by the whip, meaning that only the Hook Mech can serve as chain damage fodder until reactor cores are obtained.
*Remember that mission objectives, deploys, and ally units are also damaged by Electric Whip. The best missions to take are those without any entity objectives, such as killing a number of enemies or not taking grid damage.
*The boulders launched by the Boulder Mech are key for positioning, as they can block emerging Vek, be used for chaining the Electric Whip, block projectiles and push enemies. Never use the Boulder Mech for lightning fodder unless it has more than 2 HP.
*If Advanced Equipment is active, [[Passives|Networked Shielding]] is the best passive for the Blitzkrieg as it lets you freely zap through your own mechs with no reprocussions whatsoever.
*Blitzkrieg benefits greatly from the following pilots:
**[[Silica]]: Allows the Lightning Mech to fire twice per turn, making it extremely devastating in the late-game.
**[[Chen Rong]] and [[Archimedes]]: Lets the Hook Mech move to safety after pulling a Vek into a chain.
**[[Kai Miller]] and [[Morgan Lejeune]]: Allows the Lightning Mech to deal 3 damage early on, although it will make the Hook Mech take 2 damage when chained.
**[[Mafan]]: Allows immediate access to the Building Chain upgrade piloting the Lightning Mech.
**[[Harold Schmidt]] and [[Kazaaakpleth]]: gives the Hook Mech an additional option to push enemies away.

== Trivia ==

* The name "Blitzkrieg" is German for lightning warfare, hence the squad's focus on the Lightning Mech as well as the Lightning War achievement.

'''Blob''' is one of the Minor [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
The Blob is spawned by the [[Blobber]]'s Unstable Growths system. On the Blob's turn, it explodes, dealing 1 damage to all tiles adjacent to it. If the Blob is destroyed before its turn by damaging it or displacing it into a hazardous tile such as water, or if it's smoked or frozen, it will not explode.

==Strategy==

Blobs are not affected by the [[Blast Psion]]'s Explosive Decay ability and can be destroyed safely in close proximity to Grid/objective buildings.

Like other attacks, smoke and freeze will stop the Blob from using its "explosion" ability on its turn.

Blob Leader is both one of the Minor [[Vek]] and the Boss Vek from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

== Description ==
The Blob Boss is spawned by the [[Blobber Leader]]'s Eruptive Growths system. On the Blob's turn, it explodes, dealing 2 damage to all tiles adjacent to it. '''This attack does not kill the blob, and only does 1 damage to itself''', meaning it can be used twice. If the Blob is destroyed before its turn by damaging it or displacing it into a hazardous tile such as water, or if it's smoked or frozen, it will not explode.

== Strategy ==
Blobs are not affected by the [[Blast Psion]]'s Explosive Decay ability and can be destroyed safely in close proximity to Grid/objective buildings.

Like other attacks, smoke and freeze will stop the Blob from using its "explosion" ability on its turn.

The double attack of the Blob Leader's attack can be extremely dangerous, as it creates large areas of bombardment. The 2 health should also not be underestimated, as push and fire can no longer insta-kill it

The '''Blobber''' is a rare [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
The Blobber maintains a safe distance from mechs, attempting to attack by spawning [[Blob|Blobs]] onto any tile across from them, in the row or columns they can move in. Blobs always explode last in the attack order during the enemy turn they were spawned, and damage all adjacent tiles for 1.

Blobbers are capped at one spawn per mission (alphas included) and cannot spawn on island 1, nor can it co-exist with the normal and alpha variants of the [[Spider]] and [[Plasmodia]].

==Strategy==
Blobbers are annoying, as the blobs they shoot can divert you from the Blobber itself, so that you don't get an opportunity to kill it. In order to kill it and its blob in one turn, look for a pilot ability like [[Silica]]'s and/or a Mech that can resolve two targets like the [[Rocket Mech]]'s artillery projectile and electric smoke. But don't prioritize it over other attacking Vek nor its Blob.

While deploying your mechs, keep in mind that the Blobber will try to shoot his blob in explosion range of as many targets as possible (including buildings and mission objectives). Thus, it's possible to bait the Blobber into shooting at a space between two of your deployed Mechs, for example, freeing you from having to destroy or move the blob.

A few examples of Mechs that are effective at destroying the Blob while hitting an enemy (be it the Blobber itself or another enemy) include:
* the [[Rocket Mech]], which can position itself next to Blob and fire in the opposite direction to hit another target, letting the electric smoke behind dispose of the Blob.
* the [[Unstable Mech]], which can use Unstable Cannon's knockback to hit the Blob, while aiming at an enemy with the projectile.

}}The '''Blobber''' '''Leader''' is a boss [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the Advanced Edition. They only appear if Advanced Enemies are on at the start of a new timeline.
==Description==
Much like the standard [[Blobber]] the Blobber Leader maintains a safe distance from mechs, attempting to attack by spawning [[Blob Leader|Blob Leaders]] onto any tile on the map. Blob Leaders have two points of health and explode during the enemy turn to damage itself by 1 and adjacent tiles by 2, meaning that they will detonate twice before they naturally die.

Blobber Leaders prevent the spawning of both normal and alpha variants of the '''Blobber''', [[Spider]] and [[Plasmodia]]. 

In Unfair difficulty during 3 or 4 island gameplay, it's possible for the Blobber Leader to replace an Alpha Blobber at the [[Volcanic Hive]], if Advanced Enemies are turned on for that timeline

==Strategy==
The strategy is identical to the standard and Alpha [[Blobber|Blobbers]]; you can bait the Blobber Leader to shoot its blob in a space between your deployed Mechs and away from buildings. The only thing of note is that the Blob spawned can explode twice, so it can remain an obstacle for another turn, particularly in tight spaces with chokepoints. Additionally, since its blob has 2HP, it requires a stronger attack to destroy it.

'''Blood Psion''' is one of the  [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
The jellyfish-like Psions act as support units, providing passive bonuses to the [[Vek]]. The Blood Psion is distinguished by its pale pink coloration and bright red cranial nodes. This Psion provides a regeneration bonus to all other Vek units on the field. If the [[Psionic Receiver]] is active, it will also heal the player units.
==Strategy==
The Blood Psion is most dangerous if your squad relies on wearing down enemy Vek over several turns. Do note however that the Blood Psion heals other Vek ''after'' environmental damage, such as [[Fire]] or [[Rocket Mech|Electric Smoke]], but ''before'' Vek attacks and blocked spawn damage; as an example, enemy Vek on fire at 1HP will die before they are healed by the Blood Psion, but enemy Vek blocking spawn points at 1HP will get healed first and still survive at 1HP at the end of the turn resolution.

The '''Bombermechs''' are one of the [[Squads]] from [[Into The Breach]] added in the Advanced Edition. They consist of the [[Pierce Mech]], [[Bombling Mech]] and [[Exchange Mech]] and are purchasable for four coins.

Despite their explosive nature, the Bombermechs are one of the most tactially-diverse squads due to the Exchange Mech's power and the Pierce Mech's unique damage condition. Every turn will require careful positioning of all three mechs and the Bombling Mech's spawns to maximise your productivity.

==Squad Achievements==
;[[Hold the Door]]: Block 30 Emerging Vek by the end of Island 2.
;[[No Survivors]]: Have 7 units (any team) die in a single turn.
;[[Powered Blast]]: Pierce a Walking Bomb with the AP Cannon to kill an Enemy.

==Strategies==
*The Walking Bomb is key to everything about the Bombermechs; it can be placed in front of a Pierce Mech to make the latter deal damage, act as swap fodder for the Exchange Mech and then kill weakened enemies. Having more of them also increases your raw damage output, making the Two Bombs upgrade and obtaining [[Silica]] a priority.
* The Exchange Mech's swap ability can consistently handle multiple threats by swapping them for one another. By swapping an attacking Vek with a well-positioned bombling, it can also reliably make the Vek attack each other. Additionally, if the Exchange Mech is near a ledge with a [[Hornet]] or is flying using [[Prospero]]'s ability, they can exchange it with a drownable enemy to instantly kill it. Switching your mech with an enemy leader into environmental damage on the [[Volcanic Hive]] can also trivialise the final mission.
**Note that Force Swap cannot swap stable enemies or allies, most notably [[Burrower|Burrowers]]. Use caution when taking on an island with these enemies.
* The Walking Bombs can reliably block spawns as temporary unit destruction comes ''after'' Vek emerging. If the Bombling Mech has two bombs and Silica it can effectively silence the Vek for an entire mission.
* Look for opportunities to trigger environmental effects such as igniting forests or breaking ice tiles with the bomblings' single point of damage.

'''Bombling Mech''' is a Ranged-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Bombermechs]] squad.
==Strategy==
Compared to other Ranged-class Mechs, the Bombling Mech deploys low-damage temporary units without any pushing utility. Although this makes it tough to fit in a [[Custom Squad]], the Bomblings it deploys bring other forms of utility to the Bombermechs squad; both the [[Pierce Mech]] and the [[Exchange Mech]] have specific positional requirements, which the Bomblings can satisfy by being pierce and swap targets. By placing a Bombling unit directly in useful location, the player can utilize its position with one of the other mechs prior to moving it, serving multiple purposes during a single turn.

Bomblings are also ideal throwaway units for intercepting projectiles or blocking [[Spawn Tile|spawns]], much like the rock launched by the [[Boulder Mech]]. While they only deal 1 damage when attacking by self destructing, a Bombling can also garner additional value from igniting [[Forest Tile|forests]], stirring up [[Sand Tile|sand]] with smoke, and breaking [[Ice Tile|ice tiles]] or [[Cracked Tile|cracked tiles]]. If Bomblings can't safely detonate, they can also be used for knock damage from the Pierce Mech's push.

Because Bomblings have their own movement of 3 tiles, the Bombling Mech itself is often flexible in terms of positioning, itself also being used to satisfy positional requirements for the other mechs, or to block shots or spawns. Note, however that the bomblings movement cannot be upgraded.

While it costs 3 cores, the '''2 Bombs''' upgrade to launch a second bombling is strong, as it grants an additional action during the turn. Note that this second bombling must be launched in a different direction than the first. Alternatively, a powered [[Silica]] can be used to deploy two bomblings in a single turn, only costing 2 Reactor Cores for his ability instead of 3. When both his ability ''and'' the upgrade are powered, he can launch four Bomblings in a single turn. In general, though, the Bombling Mech does not have heavy pilot requirements, and the squad's best pilots can be used elsewhere.

Despite all the utility that Bomblings offer, picking up a more conventional ranged [[Weapons|weapon]] is still recommended, as it can offer important flexibility later in the run. Preferably a ranged projectile that can push enemies away, for when launching a bombling will not suffice to neutralize a threat.

'''Boom Cannon''' is one of the  [[Sentient Weapons]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==

An orange [[Cannon-Bot]], identical in stats and weapon damage, with the distinct difference of exploding after being destroyed. They will only appear in the '''Destroy all Boom-Bots''' objective; 4 variants total, with 2 starting frozen. The player gains 1 [[File:Icon stars.png]] per 2 boom bots destroyed, for a total of 2 [[File:Icon stars.png]][[File:Icon stars.png]] possible reputation that can be earned.

==Strategy==

While defeating them is easily done due to their low health, great care should be taken to ensure their explosive decay effect doesn't cause collateral damage to the grid. It's best to use attacks that can damage and displace them in order to move them away from buildings while simultaneously defeating them. Only free the remaining Boom-Bots from ice once initial active ones are taken out, as otherwise dealing with 4 of them at a time is incredibly risky.

Particular caution should be exercised when facing Boom-Bots if combined with [[Tumblebug|Tumblebugs]] and/or the [[Blast Psion]], since a single explosion could set off a chain reaction that deals massive grid damage.

The pilot [[Gana]] is particularly strong in the Boom-Bots mission; with Premptive Strike, he can be deployed beside an active Boom-Bot to destroy it immediately before it has a chance to approach buildings.

==Strategy==
Boosters is a decent utility weapon to keep around for Mechs that lack displacement (such as the [[Ice Mech]]) or mobility. It can be used to reposition or push Vek around when needed. And most Ranged class Mechs could use it as an escape if snared by webbing enemies. Melee Mechs can also use it to immediately move forward and bait Vek into attacking them.

Boosters is particularly effective with the pilot [[Silica]], as he can use it with Double Shot active to move his Mech before or after using a different weapon or repairing.

The '''Bot Leader''' is the boss of the [[Sentient Weapons]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''. They are only encounterable on [[Pinnacle Robotics]].

==Description==
The Bot Leader is a silver-coloured version of the [[Artillery-Bot]] and shares the same base attack. Its stats and weapon damage varies based on whether Pinnacle Island is done as one of the 1st/2nd island or 3rd/4th island in a given timeline; in the latter case, it will have +1 health and deal +2 damage per tile.

The Bot-Leader will always spawn with 2 other hostile Sentient Weapons alongside it, both which start [[Frozen]].

If the Bot Leader is not at full health, it will activate a [[Shield]] after it moves and prepares to heal back to full health instead of firing its rockets. This repair removes fire and A.C.I.D, though it does not remove fire on tiles. Since the repair itself is queued as an action in the attack order, it can be canceled out by smoke or by freezing the Bot Leader.

Despite also being classified as a '''Hive Leader''' by the game, the Bot Leader is still treated as a Sentient Weapon, giving it the distinction of being the only Boss enemy in the game that is not affected by [[Vek]] Psion bonuses. However, this also means that the Bot Leader will not take additional bump damage from [[Force Amp]] nor any damage from the [[Void Shocker]] passives; although it will still deal increased damage to other enemies if the [[Vek Hormones]] passive is equipped.

==Strategy==
Only appearing on Pinnacle Robotics, this rare boss can be difficult to take down early in the game due to its mix of defensive abilities it activates the following turn after taking damage. Notable squads that can take out the Bot Leader easily include [[Cataclysm]], which can create a chasm to instantly destroy it; and [[Rusting Hulks]], which can use [[Storm Generator|Electric Smoke]] to whittle it down while cancelling its repair action until it can be taken out. Do note that, for Cataclysm, damaging a shielded Bot Leader on top of a cracked tile will not crack it, as its shield will absorb the damage to the terrain as well.

If lacking any of these or similar options, it's best to save Pinnacle Robotics for later in the timeline if the Bot-Leader is listed as the boss. Attempt the island once more damage upgrades are unlocked to take it down in one turn, before it has a chance to shield and repair itself. With luck, the enemies will target the frozen Sentient Weapons that the Bot Leader spawns with, which can offer a crucial opportunity to destroy the boss while the other enemies ignore the Grid to free them from ice.

'''Boulder Mech''' is a Ranged-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Blitzkrieg]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Boulder Mech is similarly frail to the [[Artillery Mech]], comparatively sacrificing pushing utility for shooting a stronger rock projectile. 2 damage is enough to take out early-game pests such as [[Hornet|Hornets]] in one hit, which can otherwise outmaneuver most grounded Mechs.

The rock itself also has other utility; it can be shot at an empty tile, where it will become a 1 health obstacle. Besides pushing enemies away, the rock can be used to block enemy projectiles from enemies such as [[Firefly|Fireflies]], block spawn points, extend the [[Electric Whip]]'s current, or simply restrict enemy movement. Enemies will not attack rocks, so in tight corners, it's possible to completely deny an area to grounded enemies. Note that the rock itself is an obstacle to both Mechs and Veks though, so ensure that it also does not block your own Mechs from reaching and defending key objectives.

Due to the Rock Accelerator only pushing two targets to the sides, the Boulder Mech has less flexible firing angles for pushing multiple enemies around. Thus, it is best deployed in spots with an open column ''and'' row, so that it can immediately move to where it's needed for the more advantageous pushing directions. Pilots that grant it mobility – such as [[Lily Reed]] – are also appreciated for this reason. In Blitzkrieg, pilots and equipment that increase the Boulder Mechs survivability are appreciated (such as [[Abe Isamu]]), so that the Boulder Mech itself can be used for extending the circuit of the Electric Whip without downing it.

In a [[Custom Squad]], the Boulder Mech has a unique synergy with the [[Arachnoid Mech]], letting it spawn Arachnoids from its own rocks; the rock can be shot to push an enemy or two away, while the Arachnoid spawned from the rock can help cover the Rock Accelerator's limited pushing angles to further affect another enemy.

}}The '''Bouncer''' is a common [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the Advanced Edition. They are only present if Advanced Enemies are turned on at the start of a new timeline.
==Description==
Bouncers attack one tile in front of them, much like a [[Hornet]] without flight. What differentiates the Bouncer is that it will push the target tile and push themselves back by 1 tile, potentially resulting in a chain of collisions.
==Strategy==
Bouncers are easy to deal with in open spaces, as they can be pushed away from targets much like a [[Scorpion]]. However, the two-directional push must be considered as it could lead to further damage on grid buildings; this can be used to your advantage by directing the backwards push into a mountain or water tile. In the latter, they will instantly drown and be destroyed.{{Vek}}

}}The '''Bouncer Leader''' is a boss [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the Advanced Edition. They only appear if Advanced Enemies are on at the start of a new timeline.
==Description==
The Bouncer Leader attacks in a 3x1 rectangle perpendicular to the direction it is facing and pushes them away, while bouncing itself backwards. It has '''Natural Armor''' like the [[Hook Mech]] and thus takes 1 less damage from weapons, but not from other damage sources such as blocking spawns, collisions or fire.

Bouncer Leaders cannot spawn on the [[Volcanic Hive]] like all Advanced Edition vek.
==Strategy==
Bouncer Leaders are the most dangerous in layouts where the recoil and the base attack damage something, often being grid buildings. Make sure that they are in open space or in areas with mountains instead of buildings, then let them collide with obstacles or Vek as it is not resisted by Natural Armor. If you have forms of inflicting the A.C.I.D status, especially if the layout is on [[Detritus Disposal]] with A.C.I.D pools, a two-damage attack will instantly kill it as the effect negates armor.

== Trivia ==

* The Bouncer Leader has the lowest health out of all Vek leaders.
* The Bouncer Leader is the only Vek that has Natural Armor.

'''Bulk Mech''' is a Brute-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Arachnophiles]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Bulk Mech is designed to spread damage and displace multiple targets with its weapon, both from pushing them away and from bumping enemies into each other. Getting kills with Ricochet Rocket is less important in the Arachnophiles squad, as the [[Arachnoid Mech]] and its spawned arachnoids are well-suited to finishing off low health enemies. However, the Bulk Mech is also prone to committing friendly fire – particularly in tight spaces – as the ricochet can potentially prevent it from pushing enemies safely without damaging a nearby building.

Ricochet Rocket can target two units or structures; the first target is pushed directly away from the Bulk Mech, while the second target must be perpendicular to the first target, and will be pushed laterally. Lateral pushes or shots that hit two targets at once can be hard to set up; in the Arachnophiles squad, the [[Slide Mech]] can help position Vek targets to let the Bulk Mech accomplish this. [[Mountain Tile|Mountains]] can also be used as the first target, which is recommended to do so in congested maps with little room to move through tight spaces.

Since the Bulk Mech must bounce the rocket projectile after hitting one target, it needs clear lines of fire in order to avoid damaging Grid Buildings. Upgrading the mobility of the Bulk Mech early on can help it here, as it increases its potential lines of fire and reduces the likelihood of the ricochet buildings. Other player Mechs can be used for the necessary bounce trajectory; thus, the '''Ally Immune''' upgrade is also a good early unlock, so ally Mechs, spawned Arachnoids, and other mission objective units (for e.g. the [[Supply Train]]) can be used freely as bounce targets.

If using the Bulk Mech under a [[Custom Squad]], it pairs best with Mechs that can set up ricochets for it to maximize its potential targets; as an example, the [[Judo Mech]] and can throw an enemy in between buildings away from them, a situation in which the Bulk Mech could struggle to do so safely without hitting one of the buildings with the bounced projectile. The Judo Mech also has armor, which enables the Ricochet Rocket from bouncing freely from the Judo Mech without damaging it, and depending less on the Ally Immune upgrade.

==Strategy==
Burning Mortar sets fire to 5 tiles only, without any displacement or direct damage. This is very limited in its ability to solve enemies, mostly when multiple enemies are close together and at 1HP; as with the [[Arachnid Psion]] or the [[Spider Leader]], or in squads that can spread damage and need an extra weapon to finish off a group of enemies. It can also be useful in [[Pinnacle Robotics]] maps that have a lot of [[Ice Tile|ice tiles]] to instantly melt them and drown any grounded enemies on top of them.

However, the lack of direct damage and displacement utility mostly hurts the use of Burning Mortar, as it does not move enemies away from buildings and they will still be threats if the burn can't finish them off. Further exacerbating its issues is the self-damage with each use – although it can be removed with an upgrade, it requires 2 Reactor Cores to do so – making the weapon unsuitable for common use. Thus, it is hard to recommend Burning Mortar as a long-term weapon, as it has a lot of issues and is too situational to be relied on.

The '''Burrower''' is a rare [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
Burrowers move underground to arrive at their destination and bypass any obstacles, much like a [[Leaper]] minus the jumping. When emerging they attack a 3-tile wide area in front of them perpendicular to where they are facing. Upon taking any damage, they will cancel their attack and retreat underground, re-emerging elsewhere (within 4 tiles of where they retreated from) on their next turn. Burrowers can not end their move on top of [[Ice Tile|Ice Tiles]].

Burrowers are '''Stable''' and thus cannot be pushed or moved with physical force, however they can still be relocated by the [[Control Mech|Control Mech's]] Control Shot weapon.

Being rare enemies, Burrowers cannot appear on the first island and are limited to two spawns, including [[Alpha Burrower|its alpha]], per mission.

==Strategy==
Since Burrowers cancel their attack and hide underground after taking any kind of damage, they often require whittling them down over several turns or taking them out in one or two strong attacks. Blocking enemy spawns is highly recommended if killing them in one strong attack is not possible, since damaged Burrowers will re-emerge in the following turn and could overwhelm the player with new enemy spawns.

Burrowers can be instantly killed by water or a chasm that appears on a tile they are occupying. For example, a burrower can be killed from a tidal wave on Archive, by the water created when the dam is destroyed, or by hitting them once if they are occupying a [[Tiles|Cracked Tile]]. However, as they have the stable attribute and can't be moved, this requires a degree of luck.

Setting them on [[Fire]] will damage them for 1 damage, causing them to crawl back right before their attack. Note that fire inflicted on a Burrower will disappear when they hide and re-emerge next turn; however, A.C.I.D. will persist.

Since Burrowers can not end their movement on top of Ice Tiles (but can move through them), they can make the [[Pinnacle Robotics]] island easier if they're present on the threat scanner for the island preview; their movements become more predictable in maps with a lot of frozen lakes.

==Strategy==

Burst Beam is one of the best area of effect damaging weapons in the game; without upgrades, it hits the first target for 3 damage, and continues to pierce targets until it collides with either a structure (a building or a mountain) or runs off the map. Its starting damage allows it to take out any common enemy in the first island, but it is not enough to take down Alpha enemies by itself.

With '''Ally Immune''' active, it does not friendly fire on Mechs, trains or tanks (though still hits buildings). With 4 maximum damage, it provides a solution to several Alpha Vek that need high single target damage, where other AOE damaging weapons fail; however, it is most preferable to use it with a pilot that has Boosted damage, as 5 damage is enough to one-shot all Alpha enemies.

The downside of Burst Beam is that it requires more movement points to position, in order to avoid friendly fire on buildings, and it provides no displacement utility.

'''Camila Vera''' is a [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach''. 
==Location==
Camila Vera can be acquired by  completing islands.

==Background==
Camila is the sixth adopted daughter of [[Jessica Kern]] (who maintains an extended family of 20, none of them related by blood) from her Origin Timeline. She is an ex-cartographer and meteorological scout from R.S.T. - she was previously assigned to do field surveys and do "terrain testing" in areas where the corporation were testing out new terraforming weapons (she was essentially terraforming "Q.A."). In this role, she became an excellent pilot (the others are dead, it's an unforgiving job) and developed a "sixth sense" for piloting craft in hazardous conditions and trusting her instincts to "move" whenever she sensed a quake or collapse in the ground was about to occur. She has since channeled this sixth sense into combat, learning to anticipate and evade [[Vek]] webs as well as knowing how to pilot her Mech in the thickest dust storms without handicapping her combat efficiency. She was one of the first volunteers to fight the Vek in her original timeline after the death of her adopted mother, and also (she's never revealed this to anyone else) she has always had a loathing for insects, so she takes satisfaction in wiping out the giant varieties (the Vek).

==Personality==
Prototypical good soldier. Treats the battle like a military war. Doesn't have time for nonsense. Wishes others were as professional. While she shares traits with Chen Rong, they occasionally (quietly) clash on military issues (she's more hands-on in the fighting, while Rong's more of a supervising officer).

==Strategy==
While being impervious to webs make her a desirable front-line fighter on any loadout, her immunity to smoke gives her particularly excellent synergy with the '''[[Rusting Hulks]]'''. Whereas the build-up of smoke late in a battle might otherwise hamper the '''[[Jet Mech]]'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s maneuvering options, it can only work to Camila's benefit. In general, Camila is best placed in Mechs that have constrained firing angles and prefer being close to enemies, so that webbing enemies do not limit her Mech's options (and ideally, waste their action on her Mech).

'''Cannon-Bot''' is one of the  [[Sentient Weapons]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
A cylindrical shaped robot supported on pairs of 3 mechanical legs with a cannon protruding from the front.

==Strategy==
In general, the low health of Sentient Weapons makes them easy to take out with any attack or collateral damage from bumping [[Vek]] into them.

The challenging part comes when they must be kept alive in some objectives to claim reputation; in these cases, smoking or displacing them with non-damaging weapons is recommended, until they can be safely frozen or made into an ally where applicable. Body blocking is also effective against Cannon-Bots as their projectile fires straight and hits the first target that comes in contact, much like [[Firefly|Firefiles]]; albeit this can be more risky to block with Mechs, since the Cannon-Bot also sets the tile it hits on [[Fire]]. More preferable is displacing them to hit another enemy on top of an [[Ice Tile]] if the attack order is favorable, as fire will instantly crack ice and the enemy will be drowned.

==Trivia==
* The Cannon-bot in some objectives counts as an ally for "shield ally" effects

'''Cannon Mech''' is a Brute-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Rift Walkers]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Cannon mech is well suited for both close and long range battles. Unlike the [[Artillery Mech]], Taurus Cannon can hit enemies adjacent to it. The Mech's weapon can be used to push enemies away from buildings at long range, as long as it has a clear firing line. Since it can be impeded by obstacles such as Mountains more easily, improving the movement of the Cannon Mech first can help it get in firing range.

Taurus Cannon offers a mix of damage and pushing utility without particularly excelling at either. The weapon requires 2 and 3 reactors to increase its damage by 1 point twice per upgrade respectively. The first upgrade can let it kill most common enemies when bump damage is factored in. However, the second upgrade is relatively expensive investment for the return, since it requires 5 total reactor cores to only deal 3 direct damage + 1 point of possible bump damage, which is only enough to take out the weakest Alpha enemies.

Due to its mixed usefulness, almost any secondary weapon can complement it well; be it more damaging ones to take out stronger enemies, or utility oriented ones to deal with a larger number of threats that the cannon can handle.

==Trivia==
* The Cannon Mech bears a vague resemblance to the [https://warswiki.org/wiki/Anti-Air Anti-Air] units from the ''Advance Wars'' series; for most armies, those units also come equipped with two side-by-side cannons, and travel by tank treads.

      <comment>Removed the ending note. It is referred to as the ship or base by the pilots, but the canonical name is the Carrier, so yes, that's what it's called.</comment>

The carrier is where the player begins when they are introduced into the ship's bay. We know this is where your mechs are originally built. As we can see the combat mech and jet mech being built whenever you are in the game screen about to start a new timeline in-game. Other than the beginning intro where they are launched into the world we can also presume that it is the source of the breach technology utilized. As it is where Ralph Karlsson appears (to the player) when he first opens a new breach. 

The carrier has two main functions, firstly building and deploying the mechs into the world. And also redeploying mechs as Lily Reed makes a statement to this in a dialogue "Last one to the carrier..." [Can't remember]. We also know this is true because the mechs don't walk to the Vek on screen, instead they fly from above landing on the ground. It is possible that the mechs may also be repaired in the carrier but this is unlikely given that we have specific missions that state repair crews from respective islands instead supply repairs to the squads. It's second and most important purpose is acting like a time travelling ship above Earth's atmosphere. As whenever we fail a timeline pilots are teleported out of their mechs back onto the ship. Where we are able to choose a pilot for the next timeline. It also explains how we can continually choose past pilots we have unlocked due to this time travel technology. 


Reply to Note: It is stated as the Carrier by the pilots, also referred to as the ship/base. Carrier is probably the canonical name.

'''Cataclysm''' is one of the [[Squads]] from [[Into The Breach]] added in the [[Advanced Edition]]. They consist of the [[Pitcher Mech]], [[Triptych Mech]] and [[Drill Mech]] and are unlockable for 4 coins.

Cataclysm's main gameplay consists of the Drill Mech making cracked tiles, the Triptych Mech blasting them into [[Chasm Tile|Chasms]] and then the Pitcher Mech throwing Vek into them. Creating more water and holes is beneficial as the Pitcher Mech can insta-kill any ground enemy with them; however, it is equally as important to not trap your Mechs or worse, drop them into the chasms you create.

==Squad Achievements==
;[[Unstable Ground]]: Crack 10 tiles in one mission.
;[[Core of the Earth]]: Drop 10 Enemies into pits on one Island.
;[[Miner Inconvenience]]: Destroy 20 Mountains in one game.

==Strategies==

* Create as many chasms as possible; any grounded enemy — including Vek Leaders — will instantly perish when dropped in. Choose islands where the boss is a ground enemy (i.e not the [[Hornet Leader|Hornet]] or [[Mosquito Leader]]).
* Apart from avoiding flying bosses, island choice mostly does not really matter; most two-health enemies can be killed by using the Triptych and/or Drill Mech, while three-health enemies can be dropped into pits. The one exception to this are [[Moth|Moths]], with both three health and flying. They should typically be avoided early if possible.
* Triptych Mech can blast open two of the cracked tiles that the Drill Mech creates, which is helpful for pushing nearby grounded enemies. The Pitcher Mech can also toss a terrestrial enemy onto a cracked tile, as the damage will instantly drop it.
* Upgrades recommended to get early are '''+1 Damage''' for the Drill Mech, to create as many chasms as possible — specially if not using a pilot with Boosted damage — and '''+2 Range''' on the Pitcher Mech, for more flexibility to toss grounded enemies into cracked tiles.
* Unlike the [[Judo Mech]], the Pitcher Mech cannot target enemies facing the map borders from the front. Avoid having any enemy reach the borders as the squad has no pulling by default.
* Cataclysm can work well with many pilots. However, some to look out for include:
**[[Prospero]]: Prevents the Pitcher Mech from falling into your own chasms.
**[[Morgan Lejeune]]/[[Kai Miller]]: Consistently raises the damage of the Drill Mech to 4 when fully upgraded. This lets it immediately create cracked tiles out of the [[Alpha Hornet]], [[Alpha Gastropod]] and [[Alpha Bouncer]].
**[[Harold Schmidt]]: Provides pushing power for the Drill or Pitcher Mechs, which increases the ways that you can use chasms.

==Trivia==

* Cataclysm is also the name of an environment effect on [[R.S.T. Corporation]] where chasms periodically spawn in the ground.

The '''Centipede''' is a rare [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
The Centipede shares the movement and health of the [[Firefly]], but is armed with an acidic attack that applies [[A.C.I.D.]] to the targeted tile and the two tiles perpendicular to the direction of the projectile.

Centipedes cannot appear on the first island and are limited to two spawns, including [[Alpha Centipede|its alpha]], per mission.

==Strategy==
If you can safely keep a Centipede alive, its A.C.I.D. can be useful for neutralizing higher-health enemies, such as Alpha Vek or Beetles. Since they attack 3 tiles side-by-side, Centipedes can somewhat be reliably baited into attacking your Mechs if you entice them with multiple targets. If you can't convince a Centipede to hit Vek that are already on the board, try to encourage it to target the area of the board where Vek are emerging, since Vek that emerge on A.C.I.D. squares will immediately receive the A.C.I.D. status.{{Vek}}

The '''Centipede Leader''' is one of the Boss [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the [[Advanced Edition]]. It is only encounterable when Advanced Enemies are active.

==Description==
The Centipede leader fires a projectile goo that damages the tile and the two nearby ones perpendicular to its direction, acidifying both the damaged tiles and all tiles that it passes through.

==Strategy==
Much like the regular and Alpha [[Centipede|Centipedes]], pushing an enemy into its line of fire is recommended to shield buildings, as this also applies A.C.I.D. on the 3 targeted tiles and the ones from the line of fire. The A.C.I.D. can then be used to quickly kill the Centipede Leader and other high HP Alpha enemies that get afflicted with it.

==Trivia==

*The Centipede Leader shares the highest health out of all Vek with the [[Scorpion Leader]].

==[[Pilots]]==
Pilots control the [[mechs]], gaining experience and valuable skills on the battlefield. Basic AI Pilots are already operating at their peak efficiency and do not gain experience in combat, making it necessary for you to find find superior human Pilots, or advanced AI Pilots, to replace the basic AI.

Pilots need 25 XP to get to Level 1 and then another 50 XP to get to level 2. XP is gained by killing Vek at a rate of 1 XP per HP (eg. a 2 HP Vek is worth 2 XP). This means the health boosting psion also increases the xp value of the vek. Most Pilots have an innate Ability (not to be confused with skills earned thorugh leveling), you start with three pilots of which your choosen pilot has an ability and the other two generic pilots. All pilots encountered after that also have abilities. Robotic Pilots need 1 or 2 Reactor Core to activate their special ability.

Generic company pilots have randomly generated names.

==Other characters==
This section is for non-Pilot characters, such as CEOs.

'''Charge Mech''' is a Brute-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Zenith Guard]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Charge Mech has strong damage and decent mobility, thanks to its Ramming Engines weapon; it essentially acts as a [[Combat Mech]] with the '''Dash''' upgrade by default. However, it also comes with the drawback of damaging itself after hitting a target.

The pilot [[Abe Isamu]] is a good choice for the Charge Mech, because his passive ''Armored'' ability protects the Mech from 1 self-damage of its Ramming Engines weapon. With this Mech, you will use his special ability defensively AND offensively.

The weapon Ramming Engines' self damage is also considered an attack against terrain and will cause terrain effect on the tile it ends the attack on; this notably includes lighting [[Forest Tile|forest tiles]] on [[fire]] and breaking cracked tiles. The pilot [[Mafan]] can be used alternatively to absorb the self-damage with his shield, which prevents the terrain effect from activating as well.

The Charge Mech can be used with other pilots too, such as [[Ariadne]] with her additional boost to HP allowing the Mech to survive; or any pilot with the [[Skills#Advanced_Edition_Pilots|Technician]] ability as well. In a [[Custom Squad]], the Charge Mech can also be paired with mechs such as the [[Nano Mech]] to provide it a way of repairing itself without the need of specific pilot abilities. As long as the self-damage is mitigated, the '''+1 Damage Each''' upgrade should be gotten as soon as it's reasonable, as it is a cheap upgrade for an important increase in damage to ensure that the Charge Mech kills its target.

Despite its good damage output, the Charge Mech lacks potential to resolve multiple targets; it is capable of neutralizing two enemies in one turn with bump damage or by pushing another enemy into another attack, but this requires some luck with enemies lining up. With this in mind, the Charge Mech will benefit from a secondary utility weapon that can let it resolve more targets at once, when Ramming Engines isn't sufficient.

{{Tile infobox 
| image = Icon Chasm.png
| caption = Ground units pushed in will be destroyed.
}}
'''Chasm''' is one of the [[Tiles]] in [[Into The Breach]], most commonly found in the [[R.S.T. Corporation]] island.

==Notes==
Any non-flying unit that is displaced here will be destroyed instantly. Blocks movement of ground units.

Grounded Mechs that fall into chasm tiles will not leave a disabled Mech behind, making it unable to revive them using other equipment and abilities.

Chasms can be created from [[Cataclysm|Cracked tiles]] as of the Advanced Edition.

== Example ==
The tiles at F5 and G3 to G5 are Chasm Tiles.

}}
 
==Location==
Chen Rong can be acquired by completing islands.

==Background==
Chen is [[Henry Kwan|Henry Kwan's]] opposite. He's dutiful, conscientious, and puts other's safety before his own. Chen was a high-level manager of one of the key Teleportation Waste Sites in Detritus (much like a central hub to distribute waste to the proper sections of the island), and was responsible for transporting and managing hundreds of disposal lines at once (much like an air traffic controller in the old days, but this was governing the movement of waste, junk, and insuring there were no back-ups or stoppages in the supply line). It is believed this gave him considerable skill in tactics that was recognized during the open call for pilots when the [[Vek]] first attacked. Unlike Kwan, Rong didn't volunteer because he wanted to fight, or rise above his position, he did it because he believed it was his responsibility. Since then, he has proven a capable and reliable solider, although he lacks Kwan's battle instincts.

==Personality==
Chen is conscientious, reliable, and tries to be a model soldier. He's one of the best examples of managerial skill and leadership at Detritus, and it comes through in fighting the Vek.

==Strategy==
Being able to move '''''after''''' attacking allows him to pull off maneuvers that would otherwise be deadly or impossible, performing an action from a threatened tile and then moving away to safety afterward. Along with standard attacks, this includes maneuvers to assist teammates such as position swap abilities. 

Contrasting with [[Archimedes]]' similar but more powerful ability, Chen Rong's free 1-tile move ability does not cost Reactor Power.

'''Chronophobia''' is one of the [[achievements]] in [[Into the Breach]].

==Notes==
[[Marked mountain tile|Strange Pods]] count as a Time Pod. If going for the achievement, you should either destroy it or simply avoid picking up the Strange Object.

Thus, this achievement is best done with Mechs that are prone to friendly fire to destroy regular Time Pods while also doing something useful, such as [[Zenith Guard]] or [[Hazardous Mechs]].

'''Civilian Building''' (called '''Powered Building''' in [[R.S.T. Corporation]]) is one of the [[Tiles]] in [[Into The Breach]].

==Description==
Your [[Power Grid]] is reduced when Civilian Buildings are damaged.

Civilian Buildings are structures which blocks grounded movement and line of sight projectiles. Buildings have a chance to resist damage based on your [[Grid Defense]].

It's possible for there to be multiple Civilian Buildings in a given tile. The amount of buildings corresponds to the amount of Grid Power they are worth. Most buildings have 1 Grid Power or 2 Grid Power; and very rarely, it is possible for one to have 3 Grid Power.

Losing 1 civilian building will incur a number of casualties; the higher the difficulty, the higher the number of civilians per building (up to around 200 per building in Unfair). In-game, this will result in losing 1 Power Grid per building that is destroyed; and the number of casualties will result in a reduction of the Civilians Saved Score.

Once all buildings in a tile are destroyed, the building will turn into Building Rubble (effectively, a [[Ground |Ground Tile]]).

Buildings can be set on fire without damage.

==Gallery==
&lt;gallery&gt;
Icon Powered Building.png|A tile with 2 Powered Buildings from R.S.T. Corporation. They are worth 2 Grid Power.
Icon 3power building.png|A rare tile with 3 Civilian Buildings from Pinnacle Robotics. They are worth 3 Grid Power.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Trivia==
* While there exists 4 Grid Power Building tiles in the game, they never appear during regular gameplay; they only appear for the purpose of weapon previews.

| caption = Beat the game with 3 different Mechs from the same class in a Custom squad
}}
'''Class Specialist''' is one of the [[achievements]] in [[Into the Breach]].

==Description==
Beat the game with 3 different [[Mechs]] from the same [[Mech Class|class]] in a [[Custom Squad]].

==Notes==
As the description states, all 3 of the chosen Mechs must be unique, but in the same Class. See below section for some examples.

As an example of a combination that is '''not''' valid, 1 Rocket Mech and 2 Smog Mechs would '''not''' get this achievement, because of the duplicate use of two of the same Mech.

It is possible to get both Class Specialist and [[Flight Specialist]] achievements in one playthrough, if three of the chosen Mechs are also in the same class, unique, and have flight by default. The only class which provides at least three flying Mechs is Science.

==Example Squads==

===Ranged Class Specialist===
{| class="wikitable"
!Mech 1
!Mech 2
!Mech 3
|-
|{{ficon|mech rocket.png|Rocket Mech|x90px}}
|{{ficon|Smog_Mech.png|Smog Mech|x90px}}
|{{ficon|mech dstrike.png|Siege Mech|x90px}}
|-
|}
The Rocket Mechs [[Storm Generator]] passive creates damaging electric smoke that cancels enemy attacks, while the Smog Mechs [[Nanofilter Mending]] passive allows all ally Mechs to move onto Smoke without penalty and absorb it for an action-free repair. Together, these two Mechs have very strong synergy, and can easily provide ways to completely deny areas of attack to all enemies. Their main drawback is that both Mechs want Reactor Cores to scale well, though this is somewhat offset by not having to rely on finding secondary weapons to scale well for the end-game.

The Siege Mech is recommended as the third Mech, since it complements the Rocket and the Smog Mech by providing much needed push and damage. However, as long as it is a different Ranged-Class Mech, the third slot is flexible and preference dependent. Another good choice includes the [[Meteor Mech]], which essentially has Building Immunity built-in and doesn't require an upgrade for it, though it is lower in damage compared to the Siege Mech. The [[Ice Mech]] can work too, as [[Cryo-Launcher]] provides an alternative way to neutralize one target, and it can be targeted with Smoke to remove the self-freeze; however, the drop in damage for the squad is notable.

Any pilot can work well with this Custom Squad. A good choice includes [[Chen Rong]] on the Rocket Mech, who can use his Sidestep ability to move back one tile into the [[Rocket Artillery]] smoke left behind to repair his Mech immediately after attacking.

===Science Class Specialist===
{| class="wikitable"
!Mech 1
!Mech 2
!Mech 3
|-
|{{ficon|mech grav.png|Gravity Mech|x90px}}
|{{ficon|Exchange_Mech.png|Exchange Mech|x90px}}
|{{ficon|Control_Mech.png|Control Mech|x90px}}
|-
|}

This squad excels at turning enemy attacks against each other; what it lacks in direct damage output, it is made up by the increase in damage from the [[Vek Hormones]] passive with enemies attacking each other. Both the Exchange Mech and the Control Mech alone are consistently capable of solving two or three threats in one action, although the Control Mech will benefit from increased enemy movement range as soon as possible.

As mentioned, none of the Mechs have weapons that can directly damage enemies; thus, [[Kazaaakpleth]] can be a good starting pilot for the Gravity Mech, which also gives it the option of pushing a target away.

===Brute Class Specialist===
{| class="wikitable"
!Mech 1
!Mech 2
!Mech 3
|-
|{{ficon|Pierce_Mech.png|Pierce Mech|x90px}}
|{{ficon|Bulk_Mech.png|Bulk Mech|x90px}}
|{{ficon|Quick-Fire_Mech.png|Quick-Fire Mech|x90px}}
|-
|}

A challenging squad to play as, since Brute-Class Mechs tend to depend on open spaces to fire their (typically) line-of-sight projectile weapons. The Pierce Mech is somewhat unique in that sense, since it can be deployed behind buildings or mountains to damage enemies; or it can also use another enemy or ally to fulfill the pierce condition. The Bulk Mech can also shoot a Mountain as its first target, then use the ricochet to push an enemy directly on the same row or column.

Although each Mech wants enemies to be lined up in specific formations to get the most effectiveness out of their weapons, this Squad has strong displacement potential to enable that. In other words, every weapon from each Mech can push enemies, which can set up those formations and enable ricochets, bump or pierce targets. However, the Quick-Fire Mech is dependent on the '''Add Push''' upgrade being powered as soon as possible for it to contribute in aiding the other Mech; so any starting pilot that has an additional Reactor Core as an ability is greatly beneficial for it.

===Prime Class Specialist===
{| class="wikitable"
!Mech 1
!Mech 2
!Mech 3
|-
|{{ficon|mech leap.png|Leap Mech|x90px}}
|{{ficon|Dispersal_Mech.png|Dispersal Mech|x90px}}
|{{ficon|mech flame.png|Flame Mech|x90px}}
|-
|}

This is a very challenging Squad to play as. Prime-Class Mechs tend to lack potential to resolve multiple targets, and are very dependent on mobility upgrades and Pilots. The Leap Mech is an exception to that, since it can push multiple targets much like ranged weapons, and can afford to deploy away from enemies thanks to its leaping weapon; but it is also very prone to committing friendly fire. [[Mafan]] is greatly recommended as the starting pilot for the Leap Mech, so that it can continually survive each turn with [[Hydraulic Legs]]; his included Reactor Core can also go straight into powering the '''+1 Damage Each''' upgrade for no repercussions, as the Zoltan Shield will absorb all the Self-Damage.

The Dispersal Mech can additionally push multiple enemies to the sides, potentially offering multiple resolution; however, it lacks damage output, and is very dependent on Reactor Cores to increase its mobility and range. The Flame Mech is chosen in the third slot because, despite its additional reliance on Reactor Cores for more range and movement, it also pairs and scales well with the Dispersal Mech once '''Add Fire''' is powered. The [[Flame Shielding]] passive will also prevent the Leap Mech from being set on fire, which is particularly beneficial if Mafan is piloting it.

===Class Specialist and Flight Specialist===

==Strategy==
Cluser Artillery is one of the best area of effect weapons in the game. It provides wide area targeting '''and''' displacement from almost any position, thanks to the ranged projectile arc, letting it solve multiple enemies in one turn by wearing them down and pushing them away from Grid Buildings and objectives. The damage can get particularly high when factoring in bump damage into other enemies.

However, compared to the similar [[Artemis Artillery]] weapon, Cluster Artillery demands '''Buildings Immune''' as soon as possible; due to its wider damage area, it's a lot more prone to friendly fire. Thankfully, the upgrade is cheap at 1 Reactor Core, so this only remains a problem in the early-game with the Siege Mech.

The '''Coal Plant''' is one of the [[Tiles]] in [[Into The Breach]].

==Notes==
It acts just like a [[Civilian Building]], though it only takes away 1 [[Grid Power]] when destroyed. It can also resist a attack based on your [[Grid Defense]]. Unlike [[Civilian Building]]s, it does not be crushed to rubble when destroyed. Instead, it takes the appearance of a broken down Coal plant. Coal Plants, unlike [[Civilian Building]]s, do not act as a ground tile when destroyed, but instead remains a indestructible obstacle.

'''Combat Mech''' is a Prime-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Rift Walkers]] squad. It is their prime mech.
==Strategy==
The Combat Mech is the Rift Walkers main damage dealer and tank, designed to reliably fight and block Vek in the front lines while being given support by artillery. It's damage output is overall high as it can deal 2-4 points of damage, depending how much it has been upgraded, along with an additional point of bump damage. The push can help other mechs get in range to hit the Vek again if it was not downed.

In the Rift Walkers squad, it is wise to invest in increased movement and the '''Dash''' upgrade for Titan Fist first, due to the squads overall low starting mobility. However, in a custom squad, damage might be more important to prioritize first depending on the other mech. Longterm the dash ability is expendable; it can be kept if lacking another (ranged) weapon, but otherwise the two power cores can be reallocated later.

Most pilots will work, but a notable pilot recommendation is [[Gana]] to let it immediately deploy near enemy Vek.

'''Confuse Shot''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into The Breach]]. It is only obtainable through a Perfect Island Reward or through the [[Corporate Reputation|Corporate Store]].

==Strategy==
Confuse Shot can be a situationally useful side weapon, to offer Mechs a different effect at resolving threats. For example, flipping a target's direction without damage can be helpful at preventing [[Sentient Weapons]] from attacking Grid Buildings, particularly in missions that involve defending them, if freezing them can't be done right away.

Still, Confuse Shot is largely a situational weapon, and should only be used as a complement to the Mech's existing loadout. As with [[Spartan Shield]], Confuse Shot will also struggle at dealing with enemies that move themselves with their attack, such as [[Bouncer|Bouncers]], as well as enemies which target multiple tiles, such as the [[Firefly Leader]].

'''Control Mech''' is a Science-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Mist Eaters]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Control Mech can somewhat freely move enemies around with Control Shot, which is well-suited for making them attack other Vek. However, much like the [[Swap Mech]], it relies on Reactor Cores to scale better as the run continues; although the Control Mech arguably starts stronger, due to having more range to reposition enemies and being able to move them in less limited angles.

To get the most out of Control Shot, find a high damage Vek — such as [[Leaper|Leapers]] and Alphas — earlier in the turn Attack Order, and then move it so it aims at a Vek attacking later. This effectively neutralizes two threats in one action. Alternatively, Vek can be moved into position to block a projectile attack from an enemy like a [[Firefly]], which accomplishes the same objective. Vek can also be moved into environmental effects that will kill them, onto spawns to block them, into Fire tiles to damage them each turn, into Smoke to cancel their attacks, or into position to set up collisions for your other Mechs' pushing weapons.

Control Shot can also move other allied units that can move regularly — including Mechs, Sentient Weapons, and allied Tanks — before or after their turns action has been spent. This can be situationally helpful for moving webbed allies to safety or letting these units move farther.

However, note that the controlled movement is limited both by the Control Shot's range, and by the targets natural movement limitations:
* Ground-based Vek and ally units can't be controlled to move over water (and relatedly can't be dropped directly into water), unless they are ''Massive'' [[File:Icon massive.png]] (for example, [[Vek#Vek_Leaders|Vek Leaders]]).
* Ground-based units can't move through terrain blocked by enemy units, or terrain obstacles such as Mountains.
* Conversely, units that can fly, leap or burrow under such obstacles can be controlled more freely.
* Control Shot can't move enemies or allies who have been frozen or have no movement points; the latter which includes the [[Earth Mover]], [[Blob|Blobs]], [[Spiderling Egg|Spiderling Eggs]] and Boulders.

Much like with the Mechs own movement points, the first '''+1 Range''' upgrade costing 1 Reactor Core — for a total of 3 controlled movement of Vek — gives significantly more options and is a priority upgrade. The second +1 Range upgrade — for a total of 4 Range when both are powered — is also quite useful, but delivers less value per core.

Similarly to the [[Exchange Mech]], the Control Mech also works quite well in many [[Custom Squad]] combinations. One notable Mech is the [[Gravity Mech]], whose [[Vek Hormones]] passive allows Control Shot's utility to force enemies into destroying each other more easily.

As with other Science class Mechs, [[Kazaaakpleth]] offers a useful damaging push for when the control effect is not needed. This or [[Harold Schmidt]]'s multi-directional push can be especially useful for the Mist Eaters, who do not otherwise begin with a pushing weapon.

'''Corroding A.C.I.D.''' is a status effect in the game ''[[Into the Breach]]''.

==Description==
Weapon damage against this unit is doubled. All other damage (Push, Blocking, Fire, etc.) is unaffected.

Corroding A.C.I.D. can be inflicted on units through specific weapons, such as the [[A.C.I.D. Projector]]. It can also be present in the environment, on missions located in the [[Detritus Disposal]] island. Corroding A.C.I.D. will also disable [[File:Icon armor glow.png|link=]] '''Armor''' until the unit Repairs.

It is possible for a unit that is already on [[Fire]] or [[Frozen]] to additionally be afflicted by Corroding A.C.I.D.. A unit that dies on top of a Fire tile with A.C.I.D. inflicted will leave an [[A.C.I.D. Pool]] behind, which will put the Fire out. The A.C.I.D. Pool will also replace any other terrain tile, except for mission specific ones such as [[Conveyor Belt|Conveyor Belts]]. The A.C.I.D. Pool will be consumed by any unit that stands on top of it, which will also inflict the unit with Corroding A.C.I.D. unless they are immune. If the unit is defeated on top of an [[Ice Tile]], the tile will transform into [[A.C.I.D. Tile|Frozen A.C.I.D.]]. 

A unit with A.C.I.D. inflicted that moves or drowns on top of a [[Water Tile]] will turn the tile into an [[A.C.I.D. Tile]].

Units immune to Corroding A.C.I.D. will be labeled by an [[File:Icon acid immune glow.png|link=]] '''A.C.I.D. Immune''' icon. Units which are immune to Corroding A.C.I.D. include:
* Any Mech being piloted by a pilot with the [[Skills#Advanced_Edition_Pilot_Abilities|Thick Skin]] ability
* Any unit with a [[Shield]] equipped

Corroding A.C.I.D can be removed by Repairing, except through the [[Skills#Advanced_Edition_Pilot_Abilities|Technician]] ability and passive Healing from the [[Blood Psion]].

Enemy [[Vek]] and other units will not factor A.C.I.D. Pools when choosing their movements. This can be used to the players advantage, by killing enemies on favorable positions, where enemies are more likely to step on the pools.</text>

The '''Crab''' is a rare [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
Crabs fire a [[Scarab]]-like artillery attack that reaches up to five tiles in range. The projectile damages both the tile it lands on and one tile in front of it. Despite being named after an aquatic animal, it is capable of drowning.

Crabs cannot appear on the first island and are limited to two spawns, including [[Alpha Crab|its alpha]], per mission. Crabs also cannot appear with Scarabs or [[Moth|Moths]].

==Strategy==
Crabs are slightly more durable than the Scarab but the strategy remains the same; if you cannot kill it you push it away. The extra area from the projectile means pushing it away from the target is unsafe, but pushing it towards or to the side will usually be fine.

Though it is not shown in game, keep in mind that Crabs have a maximum 5-tile range. If possible to do so safely, pushing them towards the edges is encouraged, as it will force them to move forwards to target buildings at the other end of the map. The player can use this knowledge to their advantage by walling them out and limiting the possible targets that Crabs can hit, making their movements more predictable.

The '''Crab Leader''' is one of the Boss [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' intoduced in the Advanced Edition. They only appear if Advanced Enemies are on at the start of a new timeline.

==Description==
The Crab Leader attacks by firing a lobbing projectile that damages each tile it passes for 1 damage each and the final tile for 2 damage. It will prioritize targeting as many units and buildings as possible.

In Unfair difficulty during 3 or 4 island gameplay, it's possible for the Crab Leader to replace an Alpha Crab at the [[Volcanic Hive]], if Advanced Enemies are turned on for that timeline.

==Strategy==
Deploying mechs in a straight line in front or behind buildings is a good way to bait the Crab Leader's attention. Other Vek will also avoid attacking from its line of fire once it commits. Knowing this, the player can bait the Crab Leader to attack from a favorable spot where it can easily be pushed to the side and have it target other enemies with its long line ranged attack. The [[Passives|Vek Hormones]] passive is particularly effective against it for this reason.

==Strategy==
Cryo-Launcher freezes both the target and the user, which makes it an excellent weapon for nullifying any Vek threat instantly. Its low reactor cost is also highly beneficial for easier core management amongst the squad. However, both good deployment and planning ahead are necessary to get the best return with Cryo-Launcher; otherwise the next turn has to be spent freeing the mech from ice, which can waste actions that could otherwise be used to resolve Vek threats.

For instance, consider placing the mech on top of a spawn point, firing Cryo-Launcher to freeze an enemy Vek, and letting the block damage break the mech free from ice. Alternatively, a pilot or another ally mech that provides a [[Shield]] can also be used on the mech wielding Cryo-Launcher, as shields prevent the mech from being frozen.

The '''Custom Squad''' is a special [[Squads|Squad]] in [[Into the Breach]]

==Description==
The Custom Squad option becomes available after unlocking a second Squad.

A Custom Squad allows for the selection of any [[Mechs]] that have been unlocked, including multiple of the same class as well as multiple of the same Mech. Cyborg-class mechs from the [[Secret Squad]] are also selectable and will have their pilot and weapon restrictions applied to them, but not to the entire squad.

==Mechs==
Select any 3 Mechs, no restrictions

==Squad Achievements==
;[[Class Specialist]]: Beat the game with 3 different Mechs from the same class in a Custom squad
;[[Flight Specialist]]: Beat the game with 3 flying Mechs in a Custom squad
;[[Mech Specialist]]: Beat the game with 3 of the same Mech in a Custom squad
==Interesting Squads==
* Elementalists: [[Flame Mech]], [[Lightning Mech]], [[Ice Mech|Ice Mech.]] A challenging squad for lacking of direct damage output.
* Pacifist: [[Ice Mech|Ice Mech.]] x3. Ignores the HP values of enemies. Focus on freezing everything and blocking ranged attacks with self-freeze effect. [[Kazaaakpleth]] allows a push option and attack that works while frozen. Completes [[Flight Specialist]] and [[Mech Specialist]].
*[[Jet Mech]], [[Rocket Mech]] and [[Smog Mech]] allows you to cover the entire map in smoke while healing and dealing damage from it. Very intensive on reactor core usage but pays off well without the need for additional weapons in the late-game.

==Strategies==
* Class Specialist: [[Artillery Mech]], [[Rocket Mech]], [[Boulder Mech]]. The versatility and damage output far outweigh any downsides of ranged mechs. Preference dependent, the Artillery Mech can be swapped by the [[Siege Mech]] with the Advanced Edition update, as it rebalanced the latter's "Buildings Immune" upgrade to match the former's.
* Mech Specialist: [[Flame Mech]] x3. They are immune to fire, synergize with each other, deal sufficient damage, and push.
* Flight Specialist: Because the flying mechs have low damage output, kills will be difficult. [[Ice Mech]] is very good when combined with [[Bethany Jones]]' or [[Mafan]]'s shield. [[Jet Mech]] is not bad, even if its smoke will not do extra storm damage. [[Defense Mech]] can shield buildings, pull Vek out of position, or even kill with bump damage.
** While [[Prospero]]'s powered ability makes any mech flying, note that this '''does not count''' towards the achievement. In other words, the mechs chosen must be able to fly by default.&lt;ref name="flight_specialist_src"&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/IntoTheBreach/comments/o7r85t/prosperos_powered_flying_skill_does_not_count/ Reddit | Prospero's ability does not count towards flight specialist]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Class and Flight Specialist together: [[Nano Mech]], [[Drill Mech]] and [[Control Mech]] are the best offense-suited flying science mechs for this, especially since only the Drill Mech can deal direct damage.
* Mech and Flight Specialist together: [[Swap Mech]] or Control Mech x3. Greatly lacking in offensive power, but highly versatile at turning enemies against each other.

'''Cyborg Pilot''' is a special [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach''.

==Description==
Cyborg Pilots are the pilots/mechs of the [[Secret Squad]]. Their names and skills (beyond their special skill, "Vek") are randomized, and their portraits are those of the mechs they pilot (and, due to their special skill, cannot be unequipped from). Each one is based on a different type of alpha Vek -- one is a cyborg [[Beetle]], one is a cyborg [[Hornet]], and one is a cyborg [[Scarab]].

{| class="wikitable"
|-
![[File:Pilot BeetleMech.png|center|link=Cyborg Pilot]][[Cyborg Pilot]]

|-
![[File:Pilot ScarabMech.png|center|link=Cyborg Pilot]][[Cyborg Pilot]]
|{{ficon|vek scarab.png|Techno-Scarab|x90px}}
|-
|}

There are only three possible names for cyborg pilots: Kxlatl, Xakran, and Taaxetizl. In theory, each Secret Squad should consist of exactly these three names in a randomized order, but due to a flaw in the random name selection script, it is not uncommon for multiple members of a Secret Squad to share the same name.

== In-Game ==
Cyborg pilots have the '''Vek''' ability, meaning that rather than dying they will lose 25 XP experience to recover from near-death, meaning that if it would push their level back by one their most recent skill will be lost. Skills are not re-rollable in this process, but '''Popular Hero''' and '''Invulnerable''' are excluded from their list of obtainable skills.

==Trivia==
* Popular Hero and Invulnerable were previously obtainable on Cyborg Pilots before Version 1.2.82.

'''Defense Mech''' is a Science-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Zenith Guard]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Defense Mech's primary use in the Zenith Guard squad is to reposition or shield friendly units and buildings from being damaged by the [[Laser Mech]]'s weapon, along with moving enemies into its ally Mechs weapon range. However, Shield Projector can also be used to encase buildings and objectives near enemy spawns in shields early, using good positioning to avoid friendly fire from the Laser Mech. Using it this way, Shield Projector is particularly useful against enemies that prioritize targeting multiple units and buildings, such as [[Blobber|Blobbers]].

Unlike the [[Gravity Mech]]'s Grav Well, Attraction Pulse fires in a line directly and will be stopped by terrain such as mountains or buildings, also making it possible to bump and damage an enemy into the Defense Mech at close range; it is required to kill an enemy in this way to get the "[[Get Over Here]]" achievement. However, since it only starts at 2HP, consider raising its health points if looking to use the bump damage further into the timeline.

Pulling enemies is somewhat unique as a displacement effect, and can be useful effect to have when enemies place themselves in tight corners; however, Attraction Pulse is very limited at what it can resolve since it is single-target displacement only. The Defense Mech is reliant on more Shield Projector uses due to that to resolve multiple attacks more often. The '''+3 Area''' upgrade helps it too, as it can consistently provide utility throughout the battle to multiple buildings. However, both upgrades are expensive, at 4 Reactor Cores total (2 for each).

Pilots to look for the Defense Mech include [[Harold Schmidt]] or [[Kazaaakpleth]], to give the Mech an additional action when pushing enemies is more preferable than pulling.

''Detritus tech can break down any matter into its base elements. Their factory-cities are devoted to waste removal and recycling.''  

'''Detritus Disposal''' is the fourth [[islands|island]] in the game [[Into the Breach]]. It is initially locked with the creation of a new profile and is only unlocked once the other three islands ([[Archive, Inc.]], [[R.S.T. Corporation]] and [[Pinnacle Robotics]]) are complete. Once unlocked, it can be accessed in any order.  

Led by [[Vikram Singh]], Detritus specialises in the use of A.C.I.D to break down enemies and machines alike. Missions will often have [[A.C.I.D. Pool|A.C.I.D. Pools]] which can be key to quickly shredding apart alphas and leaders. Other mechanics include the use of [[Conveyor Belt|Conveyor Belts]] and [[Teleporter|Teleporters]], fitting the urban combat environment.  
==Map==
&lt;gallery&gt;
Detritus-regions.png
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Island-Specific Missions==
''Advanced Edition missions are only encounterable if "Advanced Missions" are on for a timeline.''

=== Reputation Objectives===

* '''Defend the Train: 2 Reputation'''
** A two-tile long train moves from one end of the map to another. If the train collides with anything or is damaged, it becomes a '''damaged train''' and one reputation point is lost. Damage it again and the train is destroyed entirely, yielding no reputation.
** Lasts 4 turns instead of 5.
** Also present on [[Archive, Inc.]] and [[R.S.T. Corporation]].
* '''Defend the Disposal Unit + Destroy all mountains: 1 Reputation each, 2 total'''
** A [[Disposal Unit]] sits in a distant spot on the map which launches a cross-shaped puddle of insta-killing A.C.I.D. There are mountains arranged so that two or three uses of the unit destroys all of them.
* '''Destroy the A.C.I.D Vats: 2 Reputation, 1 per Vat'''
** Two '''A.C.I.D Vats''' sit on set locations on the map, each with two points of health. Destroying a Vat converts the tile it sits on into an A.C.I.D tile.
* '''Kill 4 enemies inflicted with A.C.I.D: 2 Reputation'''
** Reputation is only awarded if the goal is completely fulfilled.
** An unupgraded A.C.I.D Tank is available. It has only 1 HP and cannot push.
* '''Destroy the A.C.I.D Storm Controller (''Advanced Edition)'': 1 Reputation'''
** An A.C.I.D Storm Controller with 3 health is present at the start of the mission. While it is active all units are acidified. A.C.I.D is not immediately removed once the controller is destroyed.
* '''Use the Detritus Contraption four times (''Advanced Edition)'': 2 Reputation'''
** The Detritus Contraption has two weapons, each of which can be used a maximum of two times. Both weapons affect all units on the map, regardless of whether they are enemies or allies. The first weapon shields all units, and the second weapon hits all units for 1 damage.
**1 Reputation is awarded if the Contraption is used at least twice.
* '''Protect the VIPs: (''Advanced Edition):'' 2 Reputation, 1 for each VIP'''
** Two Jeeps start off close to the frontline and must be protected. These Jeeps can hit the gas and move out of the way, but only twice before their fuel runs out. They can use this ability to move out of webs.

=== Grid Power Objectives===

* '''Protect both Power Plants: 2 Grid Power'''
** Two Power Plants are present instead of one.

===Environmental Conditions===

* '''Conveyor Belts'''
** Conveyor Belts move any unit on there according to the belt's direction during the environment turn.
** If ''Advanced Objectives'' are turned on, the '''Destroy 2 Vek Egg Sacks''' objective cannot appear with Conveyor Belts.
* '''Teleporters'''
** Two pairs of teleporters, one blue and one red, are placed at random positions on the map.
** Ending a unit's movement on the teleporter teleports it to the tile of the same color.
*'''A.C.I.D Lakes'''
**On some missions Vek can spawn by jumping out of A.C.I.D tiles. They do not land on any [[Time Pod|Time Pods]] and come out acidified.

==Regions==
;As all region names are randomized, the following list is included for completion.
*Chemical Field A
*Containment Zone D
*Containment Zone J
*Disposal Site C
* Disposal Vault
*Downtown
*Nanite Farms
*Nano Silos
*Pumping Station
*Reclamation Zone

'''Detritus Pilot''' is a [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach''. 

==Location==
Detritus Pilots work for [[Detritus Disposal]] in the current timeline. They may appear in any unoccupied mechs upon starting a new game. 

==Personality==
Detritus pilots are cautious and careful (both due to their profession), as well as polite - they, like their CEO, believe in safety first and "disposing" of hazardous material (including Vek) safely vs. swiftly. They are more matter-of-fact than other generic pilots, and focus on metrics and results. "Haste makes waste" is a good Old Earth expression for explaining their slow, methodical approach.

==Possible Names==
Detritus Pilots' names are made up of a given name (male or female) as well as a surname, both of which are randomly selected from the list below:{{template:PilotNames}}

==Strategy==
Detritus Pilots come without special skills, and only get randomized passive abilities. Due to this limitation, they can easily be outclassed by Time Travelers you encounter during your playthrough. Regardless, in most situations, having a CorPilot is still better than having no pilot at all. If they're not necessary anymore, Detritus Pilots can be traded in for a [[Corporate Reputation]] point after clearing any of the islands.

==In-Mission==
* "Hundreds of people are in those buildings, make sure they stay standing!"
* "...Did you pick up a strange glitch in your sensors just now?"
* "Seismic readings are picking up more Vek surfacing near your location!"
** "Vek surfacing!"
** "That Vek blocked the other one from surfacing!"
** "How about that - the one Vek prevented the other from surfacing!"
* About Vek
** "The Vek goes to join Old Earth in the depths."
** "The Vek joins Old Earth in its grave."
** "The Vek aren't amphibious... it'll be dead before it touches bottom, I suspect."
** "Look at that Vek fall! I think I just heard a cheer from operations!"
** "The Vek actively avoid smoke... much like our own pilots."
** "It mystifies me why the Vek kill their own."
** "It seems the Vek are as susceptible to the cold as we are.",
** "Interesting... the Vek don't seem strong enough to break free of the ice."
* Building Hit
** "Please watch your fire, those buildings have civilians in them!",
** "Please try to defend the buildings, not damage them!",
** "What a loss... that building stood tall for hundreds of years.",
** "Dispatching rescue crews to see if any civilians can be helped!",
** "Archive construction at work! Our buildings may be old, but they're sturdy!",
** "Whew, the building held! That was close!"
** "The Grid is failing! We don't have much power left!"
* Pilot Killed
** "It's hard to lose a soldier, but focus on the mission!"
** "Another brave pilot lost to these monsters..."
** "I... I think we can salvage that Mech, but the A.I. unit's beyond repair."
* Mission Success
** "Not a single Vek life sign detected in the region - you've wiped them out!"
** "Our scanners are picking up reduced Vek activity. What a relief!"
** "You've shown exceptional skill, [[Pilots|Pilot]]! Let me be the first to congratulate you on your promotion!"

==Archive Missions==
* Train Mission
** "Ol' Harold's one tough locomotive, but even he can't take much more!"
** "That train's tough, but it can't take another hit!"
** "That hit damaged poor Harold beyond repair. The last Old Earth locomotive... lost."
** "The train's lost... what a tragedy. But at least it was lost carrying out its duty."
* Airstrike
** "We've got one of our jets coming in for a bombing run! Clear the target zone!",
** "Bomber incoming! Clear the area!",
* Tanks
** "We're reading green on the tanks - they're ready to go!",
** "Those Old Earth tanks are powered up and ready to fight!"
** "My engineers report that the remaining tank should be ready for action. Send it into the fray!"
* Dam
** "That dam needs to be destroyed... we need a natural barrier to stop the Vek, and a river's what we need."
** "I hate to press, but is the dam still intact?",
** "If you can bring that dam down, do it! Better the monument fall than the people of Archive."
** "Look at that river run! Well done [[Squads|Squad]], I knew you could do it!"
** "You know, I always thought a river would look nice in that region."
* Satellites
** "No, not the satellite! I can't look!"
** "The satellite's lost! Grandfather must be spinning in his grave...",
** "I'm sorry, grandfather, we tried to keep the satellites preserved..."
** "The rocket's about to take off! I can't believe it!",
** "Rocket's almost ready, [[Squads|Squad]], just keep the Vek away a little longer..."
** "It's away! Oh my stars, that is magnificent!",
** "I can't believe it, the rocket launched! Er, well, I mean, I was SURE it would, but Old Earth relics can be, um, unreliable sometimes."
* Mines
** "Well, those Old Earth mines still have some fire in them!",
** "Please be careful of the mines - I certainly wouldn't want you to go the way of that Vek!"

==Pod==
* "Our satellites are picking up an incoming [[Pod]]."
* [[Squads|Squad]], we've picked up a [[Pod|Time Pod]]!"
** "It's vital we obtain that Pod. It may hold something that'll help us win the war."
** "Those Pods look like old space capsules... but I don't recognize the alloy. How unusual."
** "Maybe something can be recovered from the wreckage of that Pod. Though from the looks of it, I doubt it."
* Secret Pod
** "Odd... we're getting some kind of signal from that mountain that was just destroyed."
** "That's odd... we're getting some sort of signal from beneath the ice."
*** "What's this...? We're picking up a strange craft on sensors."

==Defeat==
* "Power Grid shutting down! The Vek are overrunning the island!"
* "If you truly can go back in time - do it now."

==Victory==
* "Thank you, [[Squads|Squad]]... you saved us. You have our gratitude."
* "I shall see to it Archive Inc. never forgets this historic day. Thank you, [[Squads|Squad]]."

The '''Difficulty''' of a timeline is a property that affects the degree of challenge and the final score of a run in ''[[Into the Breach]]''. Into the Breach has four difficulties: '''Easy, Normal, Hard and Unfair.'''

== Difficulty Effects ==

=== Easy ===

* Each region has a maximum of 500 civilians and the highest score for an island is 2,500. A perfect four-island run will have a score of 10,000.
* No alpha [[Vek]] will spawn outside of three-objective missions on the first and second island.
* The [[Bot Leader]] does not appear.
* Less Vek will spawn across all missions.
* Islands cannot have more than one type of rare Vek.

=== Normal ===

* Each region has a maximum of 1,000 civilians and the highest score for an island is 5,000. A perfect four-island run will have a score of 20,000.
* Alpha Vek will appear outside of three-objective missions starting from the second island.
* The [[Bot Leader]] will appear.
* The normal amount of Vek will spawn.
* The fourth island has two types of rare Vek.

=== Hard ===

* Each region has a maximum of 1,500 civilians and the highest score for an island is 7,500. A perfect four-island run will have a score of 30,000.
* Alpha Vek will appear more often and can be encountered on any mission starting from the first island.
* The third and fourth islands have two types of rare Vek.
* A Boss Vek will appear on the first phase of the [[Volcanic Hive]].

=== Unfair ===

* Introduced in [[Advanced Edition]].
* All grid health earned is doubled.
* Grid defense starts at zero.
* Each region has a maximum of 2,000 civilians and the highest score for an island is 10,000. A perfect four-island run will have a score of 40,000.
* More Vek will spawn than on Hard.
* Alpha Vek frequency further increases.
* On the fourth island, a [[Vek#Vek_Leaders|Vek Leader]] will appear in every regular mission, replacing one of the possible enemies that has a Boss variant (except the [[Spider Leader]] and the islands [[Psion Abomination|Psion]]). The HQ mission on the 4th island will also have two bosses to fight.
* During 3 or 4 Island playthroughs, the [[Volcanic Hive]] now has two bosses in each phase. The rules are similar to the previous point.

The '''Digger''' is a rare [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
Before attacking, the Digger places a normal boulder on any empty adjacent tile. Diggers attack for 1 damage to all adjacent tiles, likely destroying the boulders in the process.

Diggers cannot appear on the first island and are limited to one spawn, including its [[Alpha Digger|alpha]], per mission.

==Strategy==
It is typically best to dispatch Diggers using ranged artillery strikes or other abilities which are capable of bypassing the Digger's protective rock obstacles.  If your squad lacks any such abilities, Diggers are likely the most dangerous non-alpha Vek you can encounter, and you may want to avoid traveling to islands with Diggers until your squad obtains a wider variety of weapons.

It is possible to destroy a Digger with a single melee/push-oriented Mech (provided it is capable of doing 2 damage, or 1 + push), but some set-up is required.  You should try to position your Mech in a position where it will be adjacent to the Digger when it targets with its next attack.  Stand next to a grid building that the Digger is likely to target, or force the Digger to attack your Mech by blocking its path to any possible targets other than your Mech. The Digger won't be able to create a rock where your Mech is standing, and you will be able to attack it.

'''Dispersal Mech''' is a Prime-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Heat Sinkers]] squad.

==Strategy==
The Dispersal Mech has the somewhat unique distinction of being a Prime Mech that can affect multiple tiles with utility, by pushing many targets at once. However, it also starts with low mobility and demands a lot of Reactor Cores to reach its full potential.

Thermal Discharger can damage up to two tiles in front, and push the first perpendicular tiles away on both sides. Note that this does not include the tile at the very front, which means the Dispersal Mech is unable to push directly away from it. The pushing range is also separate from its damaging range; always be on the lookout to displace enemies into hazardous terrain such as Spawn Points, or push enemies into each other to get bump damage. If found, the [[Force Amp]] passive can pair particularly well for the latter.

The early-game is the most difficult part for the Dispersal Mech, due to its low mobility, average range, and low damage output. Getting additional movement and '''+2 Range''' upgraded is extremely important; despite the high reactor cost at 3 total, these will let the Dispersal Mech push more targets to the sides and get more viable firing positions to maximize its utility. Pairing it with positioning oriented pilots - such as [[Camila Vera]], [[Prospero]] or [[Henry Kwan]] - can also greatly assist this Mech with positioning to leverage its unique side push. In the Heat Sinkers, [[Kazaaakpleth]] is another pilot that can work well for the early-game; an attack that both damages and pushes the enemy away (something Thermal Discharger can't do) takes advantage of both Boosts and utility.

The '''Add Fire''' upgrade is very helpful to alleviate Thermal Dischargers low damage output, as well as limiting enemy movements (since enemies not on fire will avoid stepping on it). However, the upgrade is expensive at 3 cores, so it's best to save it for later in the timeline. The ignited tiles can also be used to set spawn points on fire, and used by other Mechs to gain a Boost in the Heat Sinkers. If using the Dispersal Mech in a [[Custom Squad]], ensure that the added fire does not limit your own Mechs as well; there is good late-game synergy with the [[Flame Mech]] for this reason, although the early-game will be difficult since both Mechs have low starting mobility and both prefer early Reactor Cores.

Also called the A.C.I.D. launcher, this is a building with the "Disintegrator" ability that turns target tiles into A.C.I.D. pools. It also removes any existing terrain (like mountains) and units that were on targeted tiles. 

===Strategy===
The building is under player control and only shows in the [[Detritus Disposal]] missions to '''Destroy all Mountains''' and '''Protect the Disposal Unit'''. It takes damage like a unit, but as a Stable unit it cannot be pushed by weapons. Its attack instantly kills any targets, and instantly destroys [[Mountain Tile|mountains]] too. With global targeting range, it's a very flexible instant-kill weapon and it is encouraged to use it for killing enemies as well. Do be careful though, as it will also instantly destroy buildings and Mechs in its targeted area.

'''Distant Friends''' is one of the [[achievements]] in [[Into the Breach]].

The achievement is unlocked by rescuing a special [[Pilot]] from a [[Strange Pod]]. The pod must be summoned using a "strange object" which rarely spawns inside glowing [[Marked mountain tile|marked Mountain or Ice Tiles]].

== Notes ==
* This achievement might require a lot of patience, as the glowing tiles appear very rarely and are not easy to notice during normal gameplay.
* If you're specifically looking for the Object, it is recommended to set the [[difficulty]] to Easy, which will give the player more freedom to break open many [[Mountain Tile|Mountain]] or [[Ice Tile]]
** It might take between 5 to 15 timelines to find the Object using this method.&lt;ref name="steam-research"&gt;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1318159933&lt;/ref&gt;
* The marked tiles never appear on the first visited [[Island]], nor during [[Boss]] battles.&lt;ref name="steam-research"/&gt;

== Trivia ==
* The achievement, as well as the Pilots, are a reference to [[Subset Games]]'s earlier title, ''FTL: Faster than Light''.

}}
'''Drill Mech''' is a Science-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Cataclysm]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Drill Mech differs from traditional Science-class Mechs, focusing on fulfilling an offensive role rather than a utility one. It's most comparable to the Prime-Class [[Aegis Mech]], but with better movement thanks to its default flight.

The [[Cracked Tile|tile-cracking]] effect from Seismic Capacitor triggers upon killing a unit, and this effect is central to the Cataclysm squad's tactics. Thus, at least the first '''+1 damage''' {{template:1power}} upgrade should be prioritized. Additionally, the Drill Mech also benefits from a pilot with the Adrenaline [[Skills#Advanced Edition|skill]], preferably a pilot that offers the [[Boosted]] status as well. The [[Pitcher Mech]] can then be used to throw other grounded enemies into cracked tiles to immediately dispose of them, and the [[Triptych Mech]] can use its multi-hit weapon to crack and push enemies into chasms at the same time.

Should the Drill Mech not kill its target, the flipping effect can be occasionally useful at preventing enemies with large threat ranges from hitting their targets; examples including [[Alpha Hornet|Alpha Hornets]] and [[Centipede|Centipedes]]. However, flipping won't be of any help against enemies that attack multiple targets, such as [[Digger|Diggers]].

The Electric Whip is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into The Breach]], it is the starting weapon of [[Lightning Mech]].

==Description==
Chain damage through adjacent targets.

Deals 2 damage to the targets. Costs {{Template:1power}} if it didn't start on the mech.

===Class===
Prime.

===Upgrades===
* Building Chain {{Template:1power}}
* +1 Damage {{Template:3power}}

===Availability===

==Strategy==
Electric Whip relies on other displacement or utility weapons from other Mechs to cluster enemies together, and maximize its potential damage output. The '''Building Chain''' upgrade is particularly recommended to get as early as possible. It is particularly powerful against enemies like [[Digger|Diggers]], [[Large Goo]] and the [[Spider Leader]]. It also works extremely well in low difficulty games.

In higher difficulty games, however, where the presence of high HP Alpha Vek is more common, Electric Whip's weakness is its maximum single target damage, capping at 3. This is 1 damage less than typical Prime-class damage dealing weapons, leaving most of the frailer Alpha Veks ([[Alpha Hornet]], [[Alpha Scarab]] and [[Alpha Digger]]) out of one hit kill range without help from Pilot abilities. It also lacks displacement, so any Vek that is not killed can remain a threat to player. Not mentioning the friendly fire potential that can also hurt friendly units, including destroying the [[Supply Train]] even when the train is under [[Shield]].

If not pairing Electric Whip with a pilot such as [[Silica]] (who can let it deal 2 or 3 damage twice with his ability active), it is recommended to get another weapon that can provide greater utility for when Electric Whip can't neutralize enemies.

}}
'''Engineering Dropout''' is one of the [[achievements]] in [[Into the Breach]].

==Notes==
To complete this achievement, the player is not allowed to upgrade any [[weapons]] or [[Passives]], and must complete 3 islands. It is not necessary to clear the game either, only to finish the 3rd corporate island without powering any weapon upgrades, meaning weapons can be upgraded after the achievement is earned for the 4th Island or [[Volcanic Hive]]. Squads that can easily neutralize targets and block enemy spawns are best suited for this achievement; notable examples include [[Frozen Titans]], [[Bombermechs]] and [[Mist Eaters]].

The player is still allowed to equip other pilots, spend reactor cores to upgrade Mech Health Points and Move, power pilot abilities, and equip other weapons or passives. For secondary weapons and passives, the player is allowed to spend power cores to activate them if they require them (such as [[Weapons#Deployables|deployable tanks]]), but they can not be upgraded further either.

'''Exchange Mech''' is a Science-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The Mech is available as part of the [[Bombermechs]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Exchange Mech can use Force Swap to trade spots with any two targets on the battlefield. This can allow two Vek to miss their targets, or potentially hit each other. Handling two threats in a single action makes it very strong, with the added utility of being able to swap with any other second threat that is hard-to-reach making it invaluable.

Since Force Swap has strong utility to start, it doesn't demand extra cores immediately on any of its upgrades. That said, the Exchange Mech starts with some of the worst stats in the game; at the start of the timeline, it only has 3 movement, it's grounded, and it's also quite frail at 2 HP. Thus, spending at least one core on +1 Move for the Exchange Mech should be considered a priority, in order to reach valuable Swap targets more easily. '''Heal Ally''' can be considered more pressing to get if the squad is using weapons such as [[Self-Destruct]] or [[Ice Generator]] (this Repair will revive downed Mechs and remove status effects). Otherwise, the ability to swap anywhere on the battlefield makes its other upgrades less critical than with other Mechs.

Much like with the [[Teleporter]] and similar Science class weapons, check the Attack Order before using Force Swap, in order to turn Vek attacks against each other and maximize damage, potentially having them neutralize each other. In the Bombermechs squad, the player can utilize Bomblings from the [[Bombling Mech]] as swap targets, offering a lot of flexibility in exactly where an attacking Vek can be placed. This can be done before the Walking Bomb moves, as well to putting it in a better position for the Walking Bomb to move afterwards. Easy instant kills can also be garnered by moving one of your mechs into a hazardous tile such as water, and swapping it with a ground-based Vek. A Mech without strong positional requirements (for e.g. the Bombling Mech) is an ideal target for this. Similarly, Vek can be swapped with to block their spawn points; this deals damage to them, blocks the spawn, and generally moves them away from buildings.

The Exchange Mech is also a very flexible Mech for any [[Custom Squad]], thanks to its very strong starting utility. A particularly notable Mech that synergizes well is the [[Gravity Mech]], as the increased damage from [[Vek Hormones]] is very effective at forcing swapped targets to take each other out. But in general, the utility of swapping two targets in the battlefield makes it suitable for any combination.

As with most Science mechs, [[Kazaaakpleth]] is a good Pilot that offers valuable damage and push for turns where the swap is not required. Otherwise, look for pilots offering move and/or health, as the Exchange Mech needs to be able to reach it's target to offer the greatest possible utility to the squad.

The '''Explosive Goo''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into the Breach]]. It is the starting weapon of [[Techno-Scarab]], and only obtainable by this Mech.

==Description==
Artillery attack that damages a tile and pushes adjacent tiles away.

Deals 1 damage to the target. Starts with 1-tile range.
===Class===
Cyborg.
===Upgrades===
* '''+1 Tile''' (1 Reactor Core {{template:1power}}) - Increases area hit by 1 tile.
* '''+2 Damage''' (3 Reactor Cores {{template:3power}}) - Increases damage by 2.

==Strategy==
Explosive Goo is exclusive to the Cyborg Techno-Scarab Mech, and it can only be used in a timeline if that Mech is purposely chosen; either as part of the [[Secret Squad]] or under a [[Custom Squad]].

Explosive Goo is a slightly weakened version of [[Artemis Artillery]]. The extra 1 square effect upgrade is unique, but it misses out on getting its own Building Immunity as the tradeoff, which causes more trouble than benefits. Since Veks are more likely to be adjacent to buildings instead of another Vek, at times, the friendly fire AOE can act more as a constraint than a benefit.

'''Explosive Vents''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into The Breach]].

==Strategy==
Explosive Vents has a similar area of effect to [[Hydraulic Legs]] or [[Repulse]], with the upside of having no self damage and better damage scaling, but the downside of having no additional positioning capability or utility in upgrades respectively. Most of the time, the lack of positioning leads Explosive Vents to being used as a weaker [[Titan Fist]], and the rare time its multi-hit target is useful, it is overshadowed by the problem of accidentally hitting nearby buildings and allies.

If looking to get the most out of Explosive Vents, it is recommended to pair it mobility oriented Mech upgrades and pilots.

'''Feed the Flame''' is one of the [[achievements]] in [[Into the Breach]].

==Notes==

Hitting enemies that are already on fire with a fire attack ''will not count towards the achievement''. You must set 3 enemies on fire that were not ''already'' on fire, with a single attack.

'''Field Promotion''' is one of the [[achievements]] in [[Into the Breach]].

==Notes==
This achievement is easily gotten by maxing out any pilot. If looking to get it quickly on a new profile with only the [[Rift Walkers]] squad unlocked, the starting pilot [[Ralph Karlsson]] easily allows this in a 2-island first playthrough, by placing him in the Combat Mech and letting him down as many enemies as possible.

'''Fire''' is a status effect in Into the Breach.

==Description==
Units can be lit on fire if they are attacked while on a [[Forest Tile]], or by any weapon that burns the target. A damaged Forest Tile will turn into a burning Forest tile, and will remain on fire until put out by another status effect. A weapon that burns the target will additionally burn the tile they are standing on, turning it into a [[Fire Tile]]. Fire Tiles can be placed on top of any non-liquid tiles, including [[Conveyor Belt|Conveyor Belts]].

Units that are on fire take 1 damage near the start of their turn. Any unit standing on Fire or emerging from a tile set on Fire will remain on fire until put out (or dead), unless the unit has an immunity to Fire. If a [[Frozen]] unit is hit by Fire damage, it will both unfreeze and catch on fire at once. Units can be put out by standing in water or smoke, being frozen, or repairing. 

Units immune to Fire will be labeled by a [[File:Icon fire immune.png|link=]] '''Fire Immune''' icon, though Structures will not be. Any Unit that is [[File:Icon submerged.png|link=]] '''Submerged''' will also be immune to fire. Units and structures which are immune to Fire include:
* Civilian Buildings
* Mountains
* Some friendly units like the [[Supply Train]]
* Any Mech being piloted by [[Ariadne]] or the [[Skills#Advanced_Edition_Pilot_Abilities|Thick Skin]] pilot ability
* Any unit with a [[Shield]] equipped
* Any unit affected by the [[Passives|Flame Shielding or Heat Engines]] passive, or the [[Smoldering Psion]]'s presence.

Hitting a target with a weapon that ignites it will also set the tile on Fire. If present, the fire will remove Smoke, crack an [[Ice Tile]] immediately, and stack with A.C.I.D.. Note that a unit who dies on top of a Fire tile with A.C.I.D. inflicted will leave an [[A.C.I.D. Pool]] behind, which will put the Fire out. Repairing on a tile that is on Fire will also put the Fire out.

Fire damage occurs as part of the regular Attack Order, usually at first, before enemy attacks are processed; so burning units with 1HP will die before they have the chance to do anything. This includes Healing from [[Skills#Advanced_Edition_Pilot_Abilities|Technician]] and passive Healing from [[Blood Psion]]. Units take damage in the Attack Order as listed.

Enemy Vek that aren't already burning won't deliberately stand in Fire, even if the Smoldering Psion is present.</text>

==Strategy==
Fire Beam offers no displacement, does not prevent enemies from performing their action, and has no direct damage; so its potential to resolve targets is very limited. Fire itself can be useful at killing enemies who are at 1 HP, examples including [[Leaper|Leapers]] and [[Sentient Weapons]]. It can also be used to immediately melt [[Ice Tile|ice tiles]], which will drown grounded enemies. Outside of that, fire can limit enemy movement and light spawn points on fire; although this matters more if the player is carrying an advantage already with no threats to the grid remaining.

Fire Beam can also be a situationally useful weapon for Boosting ally Mechs, if playing with the [[Heat Engines]] passive. However, the [[Napalm Mech]] comes with this passive by default, and also comes with [[Firestorm Generator]]; a weapon that already lights tiles on fire, with no limited uses, and additionally provides push on one target. So even considering the [[Heat Sinkers]], Fire Beam can still be hard to fit into an equipment slot.

==Trivia==
* Fire Beam also appears in ''[https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Beam_(Weapons)#Fire_Beam Faster Than Light]'' as a beam weapon.

Fire Tiles differ from [[Forest Tile|Forest Fire Tiles]] in that they can only exist as a result of a weapon, enemy attack, or environmental effect which directly applies [[Fire]].

The same conditions to put out Fire and Forest Fire Tiles are true for Fire Tiles; [[Frozen|Freezing]] effects, or those which apply a [[Smoke Tile]] will put it out.

'''Firefly''' is one of the  [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
The Firefly shoots projectiles in a direct line, similar to the [[Taurus Cannon]] weapon without push.

==Strategy==

The Firefly is one of the more dangerous early-game enemies. Neutralizing Fireflies, Scorpions, and Leapers should be the top priority unless there is Alpha Vek on the board.

Very few starting Mechs are capable of single-handedly erasing 3 health in a single turn, so you should push/pull them into environmental hazards whenever possible. Moving the Firefly (or moving the Firefly's target) should be done carefully to avoid exposing additional targets to danger, since the Firefly's attack travels in a straight line across the entire board.

The main weakness of Fireflies is their low movement, so cutting off their positioning options is an effective way to limit what they can attack. If they go early in the Attack Order, moving another enemy into their line of fire is an effective way to neutralize them and the other threat.

The '''Firefly Leader''' is one of the Boss [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
The Firefly Leader attacks by firing two straight-shooting projectiles that damage for four each. It will prioritise targeting two units if possible.

==Strategy==
The high damage and two-way attack makes it unfeasable to simply block the leader with a mech, meaning that it must be pushed; preferably to attack other enemies, as 4 damage is quite beneficial at taking down Alpha enemies. If your squad cannot pull it away from the map border or a wall of mountains, pummel it as hard as possible before it can attack.

== Trivia ==

* The Burning Thorax attack points at one direction to fire and creates the backward projectile as a side-effect. This means that its attack can be cancelled by pushing it to the map border if its true orientation faces it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/IntoTheBreach/comments/wsptrf/into_the_breach_mechanics_cancel_firefly_leaders/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fissure Fist''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into the Breach]]. It is an [[Advanced Edition]] weapon, and is only obtainable through a reputation reward if Advanced Weapons are turned on for the current timeline.
==Description==
Heavily damage a tile, cracking tiles behind the target on kill. Single-use.

Deals 3 damage to the target.
===Class===
Prime.
===Upgrades===
* '''+1 Damage''' (2 Reactor Cores {{template:2power}}) - Increases damage to the target by 1.
* '''+1 Use''' (1 Reactor Core {{template:1power}}) - Increases the uses per battle by 1.

==Strategy==
Fissure fist can be a decent damage dealer and environmental hazard creator, but the shape of the cracks and the limited-uses restrict its usefulness. It can fit well with certain squads (notably [[Cataclysm]]), but with only 3 → 4 damage with upgrades and no displacement, this weapon just barely lacks sufficient damage and utility to function as a reliable answer to high-HP Alpha Vek. The shape of the cracked tiles created can also be an issue, as unlike water tiles, your mechs cannot move over them unless they are flying or have weapons to let them dash through them; otherwise, the chasms can create long and impassable terrain without careful planning.

The '''Flame Behemoths''' is one of the [[Squads]] from [[Into The Breach]]. They consist of the [[Flame Mech]], [[Meteor Mech]] and [[Swap Mech]] and are unlockable for 3 coins.

As their name suggests, the Flame Behemoths focus on fire to attack, which can melt away small Vek to make up for having very little direct damage early on. Having more enemies on fire is essential as it allows the Flame Mech to deal heavy damage.

==Achievements==
;[[Quantum Entanglement]]: Teleport a unit 4 tiles away
;[[Scorched Earth]]: End a battle with 12 tiles on Fire
;[[This is Fine]]: Have 5 enemies on Fire simultaneously

==Strategies==
* Ignite tiles that vek are emerging from and they will be on fire once they appear.
* Prioritize movement and additional range upgrades for both the Swap Mech and the Flame Mech first, as they greatly improve the Flame Behemoths ability to reposition enemies. The Meteor Mech already excels at this from the start, and can remain un-upgraded for the majority of the run.
* Fire won't damage buildings, so you can freely target them with the Meteor Mech to push vek away from them, or shoot through buildings with the Flamethrower (once its range is upgraded) to hit and push Vek behind them. Not that this is not viable once the Meteor Mech's '''+2 Damage''' upgrade is obtained.
* Fire does not damage buildings, trains, or the bombs, but does damage other items with hit points you are supposed to protect that are not immune to Fire; such as the Disposal Unit, Terraformer, Earth Mover, etc.
* Enemies that are on fire take damage before they perform an action, so the Flame Thrower and Vulcan Artillery can effectively do one immediate damage even without upgrades.
* Vek that aren't already burning won't deliberately stand in fire, so you can protect structures from melee Vek by igniting the tiles around the structure.
* Use the Swap Mech to drop land enemies into water/lava; or to pull guarding targets next to deployable tanks.
* '''Destroy the Dam''' missions are tricky until you power up the Vulcan artillery. It can't be set on fire, so none of your attacks can damage it. Look for opportunities to push Vek into the dam or redirect their attacks toward it. Consider avoiding this mission entirely if lacking alternative weapons.
*Vek that are at 1 HP and die to fire damage at the start of the enemy turn still contribute towards the maximum enemy count at one time on a mission.
*Ice on [[Pinnacle Robotics]] instantly breaks when attacked by the Flamethrower or Vulcan Artillery, which is key to disposing of Alphas.
*Be careful if you have Advanced Enemies on, as there is the possibility of encountering the [[Smoldering Psion]], which silences the entire squad's firepower.
*While it looks enticing to obtain, [[Passives|Heat Engines]] is a near-worthless ability as the Flamethrower can only damage burning enemies - the only benefit is that it deals three damage and the downside of eating up your own fire tiles outweighs this.
*Some pilots work very well with this squad:
**[[Kazaaakpleth]] as a starting pilot not only grants the Swap Mech attacking power but is also the only way of directly destroying the Dam.
**[[Chen Rong]] and [[Archimedes]] help the Swap Mech survive after using its ability.
**[[Mafan]] on the Swap Mech or Flame Mech immediately increases their range with his included Reactor Core.

'''Flame Mech''' is a Prime-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Flame Behemoths]] squad.

==Strategy==
The Flame Mech's main purpose is to spread as much [[Fire]] as possible throughout the map, wearing down enemies and limiting their movement options. Since the Mech comes with the Flame Shielding passive, this can be done without harming the other Mechs in the Flame Behemoths, or even in a [[Custom Squad]].

Lighting tiles on fire with Flame Thrower is generally useful in controlling enemy movement and spawn population. Some examples include:
* Vek will avoid ending their action on fire if they have other options and are not already on fire.
* Setting spawn points on fire can immediately wear enemies down before their first action, which also helps deal direct damage to them with Flame Thrower immediately on the turn they emerge.
* Flame Thrower also pushes the last enemy away; an enemy at 2HP that is pushed away from it's intended target will be burned and miss their attack. This enemy will be at 1HP for next turn, effectively dead before it can attack.
* Enemies on fire at 1HP still count towards the maximum amount of enemies present in battle, which limits the amount of incoming spawns on following turns (notably useful in [[Difficulty#Unfair|Unfair difficulty]]). 

In order to spread fire throughout enemies more easily, it is recommended to power the additional range upgrades. The first '''+1 Range''' upgrade is cheap at 1 core, so that one should be prioritized first. Note that buildings cannot be harmed even if they are lit on fire, so with at least 2 range, it will let the Flame Mech shoot through buildings and mountains while pushing the target on the other side.

Despite all the benefits of lighting tiles on fire, the Flame Mech will benefit from a secondary weapon, as it can help alleviate the Flame Thrower's inability to deal direct damage unless enemies are on fire. This is particularly helpful later in the timeline, when more Alpha enemies at high HP begin appearing, as well as for specific objectives such as '''Destroy the [[Old Earth Dam|Dam]]'''. The Flame Shielding passive is free as of the Advanced Edition balance changes, and can be equipped on another mech to make room for another weapon.

==Trivia==
* Before the Advanced Edition, the Flame Mech started with two power, enabling a risky strategy to reallocate the flame Shielding Passive reactor core and powering additional range immediately. This is no longer a possible strategy, since even with Advanced Edition content turned off, balance changes will still apply and make both its weapons free.

==Strategy==
Flame Thrower requires the target to be on fire before so that it can damage it, otherwise it will only light it on [[Fire]] and push it away. If combined with [[Flame Shielding]] (also comes with the Flame Mech), it can compete with all major prime weapons, but it is reliant on its range upgrades being powered to reach its full potential.

Using Flame Thrower on [[Ice Tile|frozen lakes]] immediately breaks the ice and will kill any land based non-leader Vek. Ignited Vek will lose one HP per round, so as long as they are pushed away from their target while being lit on fire, they will miss their attack while slowly suffering burn damage each turn. This is even more effective with strong displacement weapons in the squad, like [[Wind Torrent]] or [[Teleporter]], making it quite effortless to countdown to the Veks death. Note that burnt enemies at 1 HP will die before they can perform their attack, and they still count to the maximum enemy spawn cap; so the ability to burn multiple tiles and displace one enemy makes Flamethrower quite effective at controlling the Vek population. Setting [[Spawn Tile|spawn points]] and [[Fire Tile|terrain on fire]] is also a good strategy to burn emerging Vek immediately and prevent Vek from stepping onto flaming tiles respectively.

With additional range powered, Flame Thrower can also be activated to push Vek on the opposite side of [[Mountain Tile|mountains]] or [[Civilian Building|buildings]]; fire does not damage buildings, so it is encouraged to shoot through them if it pushes a Vek on the opposite side away.

Note that some ally units, such as the [[Renfield Bomb]], have an immunity to fire; so it is also possible to push them away from enemies using Flamethrower without hurting them.

'''Flight Specialist''' is one of the [[achievements]] in [[Into the Breach]]. The player must start a timeline with a [[Custom Squad]] composed of three flying mechs and finish it (in any length) to earn this achievement.

==Notes==
The [[Mechs]] chosen for the Custom Squad must be able to fly '''by default'''. Powering [[Prospero]]'s pilot ability on a grounded Mech will ''not'' count.

It is possible to get both Flight Specialist and one of [[Class Specialist]] or [[Mech Specialist]] at the same time, but ''not'' all three. In other words, at least two separate timelines must be done with a Custom Squad to get all three of its achievements.

==List of Flying [[File:Icon flying.png]] Mechs==

The following is a list of all Mechs that have flight built in that can be used to build a squad for earning this achievement.

A recommended squad before the Advanced Edition released, this Squad allows for two ways to cancel attacks out; using Smoke from the Jet Mech and Freeze from the Ice Mech. The Defense Mech has good synergy with the latter, as it can also grant a shield to the Ice Mech to mitigate the self-freeze drawback of Cryo Launcher. The Defense Mech can additionally waste enemy actions by shielding buildings, and provides displacement by moving Vek away or bumping them into itself for damage.

The weaknesses of this squad is that it is low in displacement, the Defense Mech being the only one which can reposition enemies, and also lacks damage output. A good recommended starting pilot is [[Mafan]] on the Ice Mech to prevent it from freezing itself each turn with his Zoltan Shield. The included Reactor Core can go directly into +1 Mech Move, so that the Ice Mech has more positioning options.

Three Control Mechs will greatly lack direct offensive power, but they can easily turn enemy attacks against each other. Three Swap Mechs may be used instead; although they lack starting range compared to the Control Mech, the Swap Mech is capable of dropping grounded enemies into pits by swapping with them; something Control Shot can't do as its movement of Vek depends on their movement type.

Regardless of which Mech is chosen, a good starting pilot is [[Kazaaakpleth]], to grant one of the Mechs an offensive option.

Science is the only Mech class that has more than 2 flying Mechs, so this Squad will allow for the '''Class Specialist''' achievement to be gotten at the same time. The Nano Mech and Drill Mech have good synergy together, as the A.C.I.D. status benefits the Drill's Seismic Capacitor weapon for destroying enemies and creating cracked tiles. The Control Mech greatly assists with controlling enemy placements and solving multiple targets. [[Kai Miller]] or [[Morgan Lejeune]] (the latter with Opener preferably) are recommended as a starting pilot on the Drill Mech, to get the most kills with it.

This squad is lacking in pushing power, with the Nano Mech being the only one providing it. For this squad, it is also recommended to sell Viscera Nanobots eventually for Reputation, particularly when it makes the difference for getting an additional Reactor Core, as none of the Mechs here need the boost in survival. The only exception to keep the passive would be if the player gets a weapon such as [[Self-Destruct]].

'''Force Amp''' is a [[Passives|passive]] equipment in the game [[Into The Breach]]. It is obtainable as an Island Reward, through the Corporate Reputation Store, or through a [[Time Pod]].

==Description==
All [[Vek]] take +1 damage from Bumps and blocking emerging Vek.

===Class===
Any.

===Upgrades===
Force Amp has no upgrades.

==Strategy==
Force Amp is one of the best passive effects in the game. With only a single Reactor Core, it effectively raises the damage output of the entire squad. Given that most weapons require 2, sometimes 3 Reactor Cores for damage increases, the cost of 1 Reactor Core to increase the damage of up to ''three Mechs'' more than pays for itself.

The passive works best with Squads that have weapons with a lot of pushing displacement to enable bumping Veks into each other, onto [[Mountain Tile|mountains]], or even your own Mechs. A few examples include [[Rift Walkers]], [[Hazardous Mechs]], [[Heat Sinkers]], and even the [[Secret Squad]]. Even for a squad like [[Mist Eaters]] ― which has no Mechs that can push and bump to start ― Force Amp still provides a damage increase to them from Vek blocking [[Spawn Tile|spawns]]. So it can still be very advantageous with the [[Control Mech]] moving enemies to block emerging threats.

It's also worth noting that Force Amp provides additional damage to Weapons and Mechs that only provide displacement, and would normally not have ways to increase their damage output without secondary weapons. As an example, consider the [[Defense Mech]] using [[Attraction Pulse]] to bump enemies into itself for 2 damage, which would let it take out Psions single-handedly. The bump damage also works to the benefit of ally units, such as the deployable [[Light Tank]].

In general, it is almost always worth getting Force Amp if it is found.

The '''Forest Tile''' is one of the [[Tiles]] in [[Into The Breach]].

==Notes==
If damaged, turns into a Forest [[Fire]] tile. Note that the damage must be dealt to the tile itself, for example, a unit standing on a Forest and receiving collision damage from a unit being pushed into it will not cause the underlying Forest to catch fire.

Any unit ending its turn on a Forest Fire will catch on fire (if not immune to fire). A unit standing on a Forest that is simultaneously damaged and pushed off will '''not''' be set on fire (pushing happens before the forest ignites).

If a Forest Fire is frozen, it turns back into a regular Forest.

'''Frost Beam''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into The Breach]].

==Description==
Fire a beam that [[Frozen|Freezes]] everything in a line.

==Strategy==
Frost Beam has very strong resolution potential, as freeze completely immobilizes enemies and prevents them from performing any actions until the ice cracked; which can last the rest of the battle with good planning. The beam will pierce and freeze all units in its path, until it hits a structure, which can also be helpful at protecting a single Grid Building. Freeze additionally adds a layer of protection to ally units, such as the [[Renfield Bomb]] and its prototypes. Do be mindful of where enemies are frozen on though, as grounded Mechs and ally units still can't move through frozen enemies.

Since the weapon requires a total of 3 Reactor Cores to fully upgrade (1 to power it, and 2 for an additional use), it pairs best with pilots that have the [[Skills#Advanced_Edition_Pilot_Abilities|Conservative]] ability.

[[File:Ss e5f83ee0fa82c8403e6a3f28e19ac0b1ab881e6b.1920x1080.jpg|thumb|An example of a frozen mech]]

== Description ==
When a unit is Frozen, they become completely immobile and unable to move or act. However, frozen units are able to be moved by weapons that push.  They are also immune to damage until they are unfrozen by being attacked. Frozen units will not thaw on their own, except for the player's mechs, which can use their repair skill to unfreeze themselves.

Units can be frozen by weapons, ice mines, NPC units, or at the start of the battle.

== Trivia ==
* Often, freezing buildings can be an effective way to protect them from Vek attacks.
* When Vek are unfrozen, they will not ready an attack until their next turn, even if they had one prepared.
* Frozen Vek can serve as useful barriers to block other Vek from getting into important positions.
* If a frozen unit is hit by [[Fire]] damage, it will both un-freeze and catch on fire at once.
*When a flying unit is frozen, it become a grounded unit an will therefore be killed if falling in a hole.
*In the final mission, any mechs frozen at the end of the first phase will be unfrozen at the start of the second phase.

The '''Frozen Titans''' is one of the [[Squads]] from [[Into The Breach]]. They consist of the [[Aegis Mech]], [[Mirror Mech]] and [[Ice Mech]] and are unlockable for 3 coins.

As their name suggests, the main gimmick of the Frozen Titans is having the ability to freeze enemies using the Ice Mech's [[Cryo-Launcher]]. This must be used effectively to neutralise threats that the other two mechs' very low damage cannot cover.

==Achievements==
;[[Cryo Expert]]: Shoot the Cryo-Launcher 4 times in a single battle
;[[Trick Shot]]: Kill 3 enemies with a single attack of the Janus Cannon
;[[Pacifist]]: Kill fewer than 3 enemies in a single battle

==Strategies==
*In general, try to turn the Ice Mech's self-freeze drawback into an advantage. Position the mech to block Vek attacks or emerging Vek, so that it both prevents the damage and cracks the freeze.
* Get the Aegis Mech's shield upgrade as soon as possible. Gaining a shield after every attack gives the mech a huge advantage and allows you to use it to block Vek emergence, deal risk-free knockback damage, and protect buildings from the Janus Cannon's reverse fire without expending the Ice Mech's action.
*The Mirror Mech's attack can be positioned so that it unfreezes the Ice Mech and attacks a target simultaneously.
*The best objectives to take with the Frozen Titans are defensive focused ones, such as Defend the Train and Do not Kill the [[Volatile Vek]]. Freezing the train not only serves as a shield but also prevents the train from moving and ramming into obstacles without failing the objective. The Volatile Vek can be frozen and ignored.
** Conversely, the worst objective is getting 7 kills, as the squad has very little starting firepower to do so and will end up with lots of grid damage. The Cryo-Launcher actively inhibits achieving this objective.
** If advanced missions are on, missions that involve getting 4/5/6 or fewer kills (difficulty dependent) are the best as the Cryo-Launcher can just freeze Vek without killing.
*This squad has very limited knockback ability. Investing in a weapon like Boosters adds a lot of flexibility.
* Satellites won't launch if they're frozen.
*Any flying unit (vek or mech) getting frozen above a chasm will fall and die.
*Shielded mechs do not get frozen, even from the Cryo-Launcher. This means that [[Mafan]] on the Ice Mech is the best starting pilot for this squad, with [[Bethany Jones]] or [[Adam]] as alternatives if no secret pilots have been unlocked.
** Pilots with shields are also valuable to find, as they can be placed on the Mirror Mech if one of them is already piloting the Ice Mech. Combined with the Aegis Mech's shield upgrade, the entire team can be shielded and immune to freezing, which is particularly powerful with the Ice Generator. Taking advantage of this combination requires a degree of luck though, as the pilots and equipment have to be found during a given playthrough.
*Other valuable pilots to look for include:
**[[Kazaaakpleth|Kazaaakpleth]]: Adds more killing power to the squad and gives more options for pushing. [[Harold Schmidt]] can be used alternatively but without damage.
**[[Rosie Rivets]]: Automatically frees a frozen mech when repairing on movement. Useful for reviving a downed Mafan-piloted mech.
**[[Silica]]: Double shots with Mirror Mech's Janus Cannon can provide a lot of much needed damage output. Can also work on the Ice Mech to shoot and then repair the freeze.
**[[Henry Kwan]] and [[Prospero]]: valuable for the Aegis and Mirror Mech to help them move past frozen enemies.

}}
'''Gana''' is a [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach''. 
==Location==
Gana can be acquired by  completing islands.

==Background==
Gana is a construction robot adapted for combat by uploading a mix of old and modern combat routines from the Archive libraries (think Baymax in Big Hero 6). This has had… partial success, and what happened to Gana is evidence as to why he was the only construction robot so outfitted: while an excellent soldier, his expressions and outlook are a blend of construction-focused speech mixed with ruthless pragmatism. As an example, Gana may categorize an otherwise simple repair as "offending parts have been executed" - or he may start ordering a building's infrastructure to "hold the line" to prevent a collapse. Soldiers who have served with Gana for an extended period of time have come to ignore its unusual speech patterns as the robot is incredibly effective on the field (and obeys orders), but Gana can be disconcerting for new pilots. Gana has indicated that when the war with the Vek is over, he would prefer to return to his construction duties, and finds he experiences "reduced job satisfaction" in fighting the Vek. 

Note that given the recent rise in prejudice against the Pinnacle robots, Gana has suffered similar discrimination… and several officers have questioned if Gana's "sanity" in case he may malfunction like the Pinnacle robots.

==Personality==
Construction robot adapted for military use. Meant to interface with people so speaks in sentences but is very curt and unemotional.

==Strategy==
Great care should be taken to avoid placing Gana in dangerous situations when utilizing Preemptive Strike; while it is frequently a great move to cause enemies to focus on your own troops rather than vital Grid Power or objectives, Preemptive Strike by itself will not be able to neutralize anything but the weakest of enemies, and can leave Gana's Mech dangerously exposed and vulnerable without escape.

It's sometimes better to prioritize deploying Gana's Mech in a tile that prevents enemies from moving further, rather than maximizing damage dealt on deployment. Also, note that the damage caused by Preemptive Strike will be less effective in islands with the [[Blood Psion]], the [[Shell Psion]], and the [[Soldier Psion]] to a lesser extent.

On the first part of the [[Volcanic Hive|final stage]], Gana's mech can deploy anywhere except in tiles where Power Pylons will land after deployment; the game will not highlight them, which effectively gives information to the player about what the layout of Power Pylons will look like before the mission starts. On the second part, you cannot manually place Gana's mech, but the mech will still deal 1 damage to adjacent enemies upon landing.

}}The '''Gastropod''' is a common [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the Advanced Edition. They are only present if Advanced Enemies are turned on at the start of a new timeline.
==Description==
Gastropods fire a grappling hook that deals 1 damage to the target and either pulls it to the Gastropod or the other way around, depending on if the target is immovable. If the hook does not hit anything the Gastropod does not move. Despite being based off an aquatic animal they are able to drown.

==Strategy==
Much like the [[Firefly]], the Gastropod's high health and projectile-based attack are very dangerous in the early game since they are difficult to remove. However, Gastropods can pull other Vek away from targets and lack non-grappling movement, which can be used to your advantage in protecting objectives or the grid.

Gastropods are also capable of pulling themselves towards solid structures, including [[Mountain Tile|Mountains]]. In particular, try and redirect their attack so that they pull themselves to a mountain located right next to a chasm or water tile, and they'll instantly be destroyed after attacking.

The '''Gastropod Leader''' is one of the Boss [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the [[Advanced Edition]]. It is only encountered when Advanced Enemies are active.

==Description==
The Gastropod leader fires a projectile hook that deals three damage, pulling most units towards the Gastropod Leader, or it towards units with the [[File:Icon guard glow.png]] '''Stable''' attribute or stationary objects. After the attack, it sets adjacent tiles on [[Fire]], always setting the damaged target on fire. Despite that, the Gastropod Leader itself is not immune to being set on fire, and will still take damage every turn if it is afflicted with it. Because the Gastropod Leader is a '''Massive''' enemy, it's immune to being drowned, which means it can also put itself out of fire if it pulls itself towards a structure and stops at a [[Water Tile]] (but will still be on fire if it simply passes through one).
==Strategy==
The Gastropod leader is a remarkably weak boss, the only benefits over an [[Alpha Gastropod]] being +2 health, massive, and the fire effect. The fire effect is interesting in that it can be used to one's advantage, as knocking the Gastropod Leader onto a fire tile is a great way to defeat it. Also keep in mind that the fire only hurts units, so the Gastropod Leader setting a building on fire has no effect.

'''Glittering C-Beam''' is one of the [[achievements]] in [[Into the Breach]].

==Notes==
It is not necessary to actually damage the enemies being hit. For example, if an enemy has its laser damage reduced to 0 due to a [[Shell Psion]], it still counts as a hit for this achievement.

== Trivia ==

* The achievement's name is a nod to the monologue by the character '''Roy Batty''', from the cult science fiction film [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears_in_rain_monologue Blade Runner].

The '''Grappling Hook''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into the Breach]]. It is the starting weapon of [[Hook Mech]].

==Description==
Use a grapple to pull Mech towards immovable objects, or units to the Mech.

===Class===
Brute.

===Upgrades===
* '''Shield Ally''' (1 Reactor Core {{Template:1power}}) - If used on an ally unit, it gives them a [[Shield]].

==Strategy==
Grappling Hook distinguishes itself from other Brute-class weapons by providing pure pulling utility. The Mech using it is capable of pulling any non-stable unit towards itself over long distances, offering good displacement range for placing enemies to attack each other. Grappling Hook does require a clear line of sight though, so it can be less impactful in maps with a lot of obstacles in the middle.

Other use cases for Grappling Hook include pulling in units without damaging them; this is useful for specific objectives, such as Defending the [[Volatile Vek]] or freezing [[Sentient Weapons]]. Note that the '''Shield Ally''' upgrade will also protect other ally units as well, such as the [[Renfield Bomb]] and its prototypes. Grappling Hook can also work well off-class; particularly with Prime-class Mechs that lack pulling equipment, or with flying Science-class Mechs that make it easier to position themselves with their movement type and lack [[Teleporter]].

'''Gravity Mech''' is a Science-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Steel Judoka]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Gravity Mech is useful for turning the Vek against each other, thanks to its Vek Hormones Passive that it comes equipped with, which effectively makes the enemy deal high amounts of damage for the player.

The Grav Well weapon can be used to pull Vek towards it, disrupting attacks and positioning them to attack other enemies. Unlike [[Attraction Pulse]], this attack is lobbed in an arc, like an artillery projectile; while it is not able to pull enemies into the Gravity Mech for bump damage, it is possible to pull distant enemies into each other or onto structures such as Mountains.

The Vek Hormones makes all enemies — including [[Sentient Weapons]] and [[Vek#Vek_Minion|minor enemies]] — deal extra damage to each other. It can also be further upgraded in damage, scaling very well in higher difficulties where more Alpha enemies are present. The first '''+1 Damage''' upgrade lets all Alpha enemies deal 4-5 damage to enemies, which is enough to let them destroy other Alphas; the second damage upgrade is more costly at 2 Reactor Cores and has less valuable return, but it is still useful for letting other Alphas take down Vek Leaders (most of which have 6HP). The passive overall works well with the Steel Judoka squad, as all its mechs have weapons that can manipulate enemy positions. If using the Grav Mech in a [[Custom Squad]], it is recommended to similarly pair it with Mechs that excel at manipulating enemy positions; notable examples including the [[Control Mech]] and [[Exchange Mech]].

Because of how well the extra damage Vek deal to each other scales, look for islands with enemies that fire in a straight line such as [[Firefly|Firefiles]] and [[Gastropod|Gastropods]].

==Trivia==
* The Vek Hormones passive equipped with the Gravity Mech also increases the damage done by [[Sentient Weapons|robotic enemies]], despite not being classified as Vek nor affected by Psions.

The '''Grid Charger''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into The Breach]]. It is an [[Advanced Edition]] weapon, and is only obtainable through reputation reward or [[Time Pod]] if Advanced Weapons are turned on for the current timeline.

==Description==
Killing an enemy will charge the [[Grid Power|Power Grid]] 1 point. Single-use.

Deals 1 damage, and costs 1 Reactor Core {{template:1power}} to power.

===Class===
Any.

===Upgrades===
Grid Charger has no upgrades.

==Strategy==
Being a weak, single target, limited use, ''and'' melee range attack, makes Grid Charger a very situational weapon with limited resolution potential. It is the only weapon in the game that can repair Grid Damage — which can possibly save the player from failing the timeline — but it has to kill the enemy in order for this effect to activate; do note that it can activate on [[Vek#Vek_Minions|Minor Vek enemies]] and [[Sentient Weapons]] as well though. It benefits the most from a pilot that has the '''[[Skills#Advanced_Edition_Pilot_Abilities|Conservative]]''' ability, and preferably access to damage boosts or A.C.I.D. in the Squad.

Killing an enemy with full Grid will increase the Grid Defense percentage chance. If the Grid can be kept at full, this can be used each battle to change the outcome of a building attack, possibly to a resist (see "[[Grid_Power#Resists_&amp;_Resets|Fish for Resists]]" for more information on this strategy). This is, however, a risky strategy that also relies on luck, and is more safely done with [[Isaac Jones]] providing a safety net with a second reset per battle.

Note that destroying the [[Old Earth Dam]] with Grid Charger will also refill the Grid, but only once for the destroyed Dam; it will not increase further Grid with subsequent kills from drowning grounded Vek with the created water tiles.

The final quirk to note with Grid Charger is that it will roll back the Grid Damage counter for the '''Take Less than 3 Grid Damage''' objective, so it is the only weapon that can possibly save this objective back from failure.

The '''Power Grid''' indicator shows how much Grid Power remains. The player begins the game with 5 Grid Power and may have up to 7. If Grid Power would be increased beyond 7, [[Grid Defense]] increases instead.

Increases and decreases to Grid Power persist between [[Islands]]. 

[[File:Power Grid.jpg|thumb]]

== Gaining Grid Power ==
Grid Power can be regained by the following means:
* Some missions grant [[File:power.png]] Grid Power as a [[Resources|Resource]] reward for completing bonus objective(s). *
*After finishing a Corporate Island, the player can buy 2 [[File:power.png]] Grid Power for every 1 [[File:Icon stars.png]] [[Corporate Reputation]] point spent. *
*When completing a [[Perfect Island]], the player can choose +2 [[File:power.png]] Grid Power as their reward. *
*The [[Grid Charger]] weapon, if found, restores 1 [[File:power.png]] Grid Power when used successfully.
''(* On [[Difficulty#Unfair|Unfair]] difficulty, this gain is doubled.)''

== Grid Defense ==
Grid Defense is the percentage chance that a building tile will resist damage. Grid Defense starts at 15%. ''(On'' ''Unfair difficulty, Grid Defense starts at 0% but can still be increased.)''

Grid Defense can be increased by the following means:
* '''Overpower Bonus.''' Each point of [[File:power.png]] Grid Power obtained when the Power Grid is full increases Grid Defense by 2% (the first 5 times), then by 1%, up to a maximum of +25%.
*'''Pilot Bonus.''' While equipped, a [[Pilots|pilot]] with the '''+3 Grid DEF''' skill increases Grid Defense by that amount. With three pilots, this bonus can reach +9%.
Combined, these bonuses can raise Grid Defense to a maximum of 49%. ''(34% on Unfair difficulty)''

=== Resists &amp; Resets ===
''(This section discusses a quirk of the Grid Defense mechanic.)''

''Into the Breach'' uses a [[wikipedia:Random_seed|seeded]] random number generator to see if the Grid will resist damage. If a Grid Building tile is hit during the player's turn and does not resist, using the '''Reset Turn''' button will not change the outcome. Similarly, if the Grid resists damage three times in a row during the player's turn, resetting the turn will not change the outcome. In both cases, the source of the damage and the specific building hit also have no impact on the outcome.

Players can exploit these predetermined outcomes to '''"fish for resists"''', a risky technique which can be useful in some situations. Example: An Alpha Firefly is targeting a tile which contains 2 buildings. The player is ready to put a Mech in the way of the Firefly's projectile, disabling the Mech and killing the pilot. However, there is a chance the building ''might'' resist the attack, which would avoid an unnecessary sacrifice. The player uses a Mech to damage one of the buildings on the map, which luckily resists. Knowing this, the player resets the turn and does not block the Firefly's projectile. When the player's turn ends, the Firefly hits the building. The building remains intact, saving the Mech and the pilot from a pointless death.

In the unlikely event that Grid Defense changes during a mission (due to [[Grid Charger]], a pilot gaining the [[Skills#Base_Game_Pilot_Abilities|+3 Grid DEF]] skill, or a pilot with that skill dying between missions), ''and'' this would have caused the outcome to be different, the outcome will change.

==Lore==
In the world of ''Into the Breach'', Grid Power is the source of energy that powers [[Mechs]]. This energy is distributed through a common network across the Corporate Islands. When Power Grid is destroyed, the Mechs are disabled and Vek emerge from the underground in great numbers, and the timeline is lost. The player may bring one surviving pilot back to the [[Carrier]] to try again in a different timeline.

'''Harold Schmidt''' is a [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach''. 
==Location==
Harold Schmidt can be acquired by perfectly completing the objectives for [[Archive, Inc.]] or by recovering a [[Time Pod]].

==Background==
Harold Schmidt [Archive] 

Harold is as close as they come to an engineering "sociopath" (this is not the clinical term - co-workers in previous timelines used to call him a "technopath," but even that's not an accurate term for his lack of empathy and social skills). He finds humans uncomfortable and confusing, and takes solace in tinkering with robotics and machines who have clear rulesets and reasons for what they do. In his original timeline, he served a brief term at Detritus (where he seemed bored and uncommunicative), then was rejected from Pinnacle due to his psychological exam, then found a home in Archive, studying and doing restoration work on Old Earth robotics. 

He initially applied to Archive's open-call for pilot training so it could get him closer to the Mech technology, then it was discovered he did well on the pilot exam (better than most Archive volunteers), and he agreed to serve as a soldier as a way of giving him access to the cutting edge of Mech technology. (Note that Harold doesn't bear any ill-will toward Detritus and Pinnacle, nor do they bear him any ill-will... however, both Singh's predecessor and Zenith saw Harold's lack of empathy, and were worried it could lead to accidents or disregard for human life while he was carrying out his duties.)

==Personality==
Inquisitive; Focused on learning more than just fighting. Easily distracted. Somewhat disinterested and uncaring. Not very empathic.

==Strategy==
Harold's ability grants an entirely free extra form of attack or defense all on its own, being that Repairs can be activated even when not damaged. He pairs well with highly maneuverable Mechs that lack pushing with their default loadouts for superior battlefield control — notable examples include the [[Jet Mech]] and [[Thruster Mech]] — as well as those that can safely intercept incoming damage and block spawns often, being that he's encouraged to Repair more frequently.

This versatility allows a skilled player to focus on outfitting other Mechs with greater power and equipment much more quickly.

"I wonder... were any significant technological divergences in this timeline? I suppose we'll see in the battles ahead!",
"I'm back - almost as if nothing happened. How long can this cycle continue?",
"I wonder... are these breaches causing any damage to the timeline? The tachyon emissions alone...",
"I wonder... who first invented the breach technology? And why was it used here, on these islands?"
|-

"Well, looks like we have another Vek situation here... time to roll up the sleeves and get my hands dirty.",
"I do hope I get to meet Dr. Renfield in this timeline and say what a success his bomb was in the last timeline!",
"I hope this timeline found a way to mount a Renfield bomb on a missile and save us from having to do volcano island duty."

"The casualties are unfortunate... but I wonder... why do the Vek attack the buildings at all?",
"I... I had thought the buildings were durable, but the Vek...",
|-

|Bldg_Resisted
|Building resists damage, currently anyone can comment but I can change this to _Obs/_Self/_Vek if we think it's worth it.

The '''Hazardous Mechs''' are one of the [[Squads]] from [[Into The Breach]]. They consist of the [[Leap Mech]], [[Unstable Mech]] and [[Nano Mech]] and are unlockable for 4 coins.

This squad has obscene damaging abilities as the Leap and Unstable mechs both have powerful pushing weapons. However, everything comes with the price of dealing self-damage, relying on the Nano Mech's [[A.C.I.D. Projector]] and its signature passive [[Viscera Nanobots]] to stay fighting.

==Achievements==
;[[Healing]]:Heal 10 Mech Health in a single battle.
;[[Immortal]]:Finish 4 Corporate Islands without a Mech being destroyed at the end of a battle.
;[[Overkill]]:Deal 8 damage to a unit with a single attack.

==Strategies==
*Keep your Nano Mech alive at all times, and your other two mechs are virtually immortal. Viscera Nanobots will heal a mech even if its health would be reduced to zero or lower, including [[Self-Destruct]]. This ability doesn't account for negative numbers, so if your mech's health has been reduced to a negative number, the game will just treat mech's HP as 0 and heal the according amount of HP.
**For example, if your Unstable Mech has 1HP, has Upgrade I powered and kills two enemies in one attack, it will have 2HP after the attack resolution.
*The A.C.I.D projector is key to killing high-health targets such as the [[Firefly]] with the Unstable Mech.
*All of this squad's weapons push enemies, so beware of inside corners, particularly where one of the obstacles is a city or allied unit, and either occupy them with your own mechs or prevent enemies from moving into them.
*Get the +1 Heal upgrade on Viscera Nanobots first before any other damage upgrades.
*If Advanced Equipment is enabled, [[Networked Shielding]] fully negates any self-damage and voids the purpose of Viscera Nanobots.
*Recommended starting pilots include:
** [[Mafan]] can use the Zoltan Shield each turn to absorb self-damage, and can use the included reactor core to immediately power +1 damage each.
** [[Abe Isamu]] prevents the initial 1 point of self damage from Hydraulic Legs and Unstable Cannon, allowing you to get their +1 damage each upgrades early.
** To a lesser extent, [[Ariadne]]'s +3HP can tank the self-damage and can also get the +1 damage each upgrades early, provided she gets kill-shots to auto-repair some of the lost HP.
*Other pilots to look out for include:
**Any pilot with '''Conservative''' if you have Self-Destruct.
**[[Chen Rong]] and [[Archimedes]]: Lets you move one of your mechs after attacking, which is important as the Leap Mech likes to enter into enemy fire. Also helps the Nano Mech escape trouble.
**[[Silica]]: Lets the Leap Mech hop twice before actually moving.
**[[Morgan Lejeune]]: Lets you keep the boost in case Viscera Nanobots does not fully heal, which is often the case after getting health upgrades.
**[[Rosie Rivets]]: can pilot the Nano Mech and be positioned to repair and revive the other two mechs, decreasing the squad's reliance on Viscera Nanobots.

The '''Heat Converter''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into The Breach]], it is not a starting weapon of any [[Mechs|Mech]] but obtainable through reputation reward or [[Time Pod]].

==Strategy==
Heat Converter can consistently neutralize one target per use by freezing it. The burn effect is especially useful in the [[Pinnacle Robotics]] island, where the player can melt ice tiles as needed. Just remember, igniting a land based Vek on an ice tile, and freezing a flying Vek (even flying Vek Leaders) over chasm tiles, are both instant kills.

'''Heat Engines''' is a [[Passives|passive]] equipment in the game [[Into The Breach]]. It is part of the starting loadout for the [[Napalm Mech]]. If the [[Advanced Edition]] weapons are turned on for the timeline, it is also obtainable as an Island Reward, through the Corporate Reputation Store, or through a [[Time Pod]].

==Strategy==
Heat Engines allows any Mech in the squad to be immune to fire, as well as remove the fire from the tile they end their movement on and consume it for a Boost. The Boost status increases the damage of all weapons by 1, and the effectiveness of repairing by 1HP (for a total of 2HP). Since the passive depends on Fire being present so it can be consumed to have any effect, it is most recommended to be used with at least one Mech that can spread Fire, along with other Mechs that have damaging weapons. The [[Heat Sinkers]] start with it, and is what helps increase their damage output.

Outside of its home squad though, Heat Engines is more situational. It could be useful if found with the [[Flame Behemoths]], but more-so for their late-game, as they only deal direct damage conditionally (in the case of the [[Flame Mech]]) or with upgrades (in the case of the [[Meteor Mech]]). Removing fire tiles to consume for Boosts might also be a downside for the Flame Behemoths, as they depend on burning and pushing enemies away to take them down and control Vek spawn population. Heat Engines could also help the [[Mist Eaters]] increase their damage output using the Fire from [[Smoldering Shells]], particularly for the [[Thruster Mech]]; although the Boost does also increase self-damage, it can be repaired with Smoke thanks to [[Nanofilter Mending]]. Finally, Heat Engines could be useful to keep for the [[Volcanic Hive]], as there's a lot of environmental Fire effects in this battle, and if the player has high damage weapons to take advantage of the Boosts.

The '''Heat Sinkers''' are one of the [[Squads]] from [[Into The Breach]] added in the Advanced Edition. They consist of the [[Dispersal Mech]], [[Quick-Fire Mech]] and [[Napalm Mech]] and are unlockable for four coins.

Much like how the [[Mist Eaters]] consume smoke, the Heat Sinkers consume flame tiles to boost their mechs' damage by one point for one attack. While the boost status and fire damage are very powerful, the squad's effectiveness depends wholly on if you can boost every turn, especially as the increased damage has to make up for each mech's low health.

==Squad Achievements==
;[[Boosted]]: Boost 8 Mechs in one mission.
;[[Feed the Flame]]: Light 3 Enemies on fire with a single attack.
;[[Maximum Firepower]]: Deal 8 damage with a single activation of the [[Quick-Fire Rockets]].

==Strategies==

* To guarantee two boosts when starting a mission the Napalm Mech can be placed behind the two other mechs and fire immediately. However, this will severely limit your starting control of the map and is dangerous on positioning-heavy missions such as the train.
*The Quick-Fire Mech does not have any pushing power when beginning a new timeline and is extremely fragile on island 1. Boost it as much as possible and use your Dispersal Mech to push away any webbers - taking 1 damage is better than losing an entire mech.
*When unlocked, the Push upgrade for the Quick Fire mech adds needed damage by bumping and enables pushing enemies into environmental tiles. Consider placing your time traveller on it if it has a bonus reactor core, otherwise unlock this upgrade with the first core earned; it is vital for this Squad to have additional displacement as soon as possible.
*To maintain boosts, upgrade II for the Dispersal Mech and both range upgrades for the Napalm Mech are very useful for lighting many tiles on fire.
* The '''Maximum Firepower''' achievement can be fulfilled in many ways, even being possible to fulfill after a single core by powering push, being boosted, and bumping two vek into two more vek. Another more reliable setup is to fully upgrade the weapon to shoot one vek without bump and bump another vek into a third. The use of [[Abilities and status effects|A.C.I.D.]] can circumvent this and make the setup much easier.
* Without boosts, the Heat Sinkers damage output is very low, this issue being most pronounced in the early game when the Napalm Mech lacks much range and the Dispersal Mech has no fire added. Consider choosing Archive or Detritus as the first island to make the early game easier; the former has maps with plenty of forest tiles to light on fire, while the latters' A.C.I.D. can help increase your damage output even if not boosted.
*Additionally, look for islands that have the [[Smoldering Psion]] or bosses that light tiles on fire, such as the [[Beetle Leader]]; the fire leftover from these enemies can be consumed by the Heat Sinkers as well.
*Pilot recommendations include:
**[[Chen Rong]] and [[Archimedes]] in the Quick-Fire Mech, as their ability lets them set up boosts every turn by moving to a flaming tile after using their weapon.
**[[Kai Miller]] or [[Morgan Lejeune]] in the Quick-Fire Mech allow it to depend less on consuming fire to set up boosts.
**Since the Dispersal Mech's weapon only pushes on its non-damaging side range, [[Kazaaakpleth]] can be a great pilot choice to give it a way of pushing and damaging enemies directly adjacent to it; this is particularly helpful in the early game.
**[[Henry Kwan]] or [[Prospero]] on the Dispersal Mech are also helpful to let it attack from as many angles as possible, particularly once it has upgraded range.
**[[Silica]] piloting the Napalm Mech with double shot active allows the squad to spread fire through the map by shooting firestorm generator twice.

==Trivia==

* The Heat Sinkers are one of two squads with only one Mech that starts at 3 health and the other at 2 health, the other being the [[Secret Squad]].

==Strategy==
Heavy Rocket is the Brute class equivalent to the Prime class weapon [[Mercury Fist]]; it deals high damage to a single target, pushes adjacent targets around it, and has limited uses. The main difference is that Heavy Rocket, like many Brute weapons, can be fired as a projectile; but it does cost one more Reactor Core to fully upgrade by comparison.

Nevertheless, with the '''+2 Damage''' upgrade active, Heavy Rocket deals a total of 5 damage to one target, which is enough to take out any Alpha enemy in a single action; and with a Boosted Pilot, it can take out most Vek Leaders. Thus, it is a good pick for Brute Mechs that lack a strong weapon to quickly destroy high HP targets, such as the [[Jet Mech]] and [[Hook Mech]].

'''Henry Kwan''' is a [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach''. 
==Location==
Henry Kwan can be acquired by  completing islands.

==Background==
Henry Kwan is perhaps the least reliable and least safety-minded worker in Detritus. It seemed he would be forever relegated to a low-level A.C.I.D. report-filing bureau at Detritus - until the [[Vek]] attacked. Impulsively, he applied for the open call for pilot training, and he passed the aptitude test with flying colors (his instincts and reflexes seemed to shine in "think-fast" situations - as well as situations where he could cause a lot of damage... intentionally.). While hardly the most modest employee at Detritus, his accomplishments in battle have only fed his ego. Despite the timelines lost, Henry seems to see it all as some sort of game, and remains distant from the actual suffering - some suspect his jokes and boasting are a psychological shield, and thus, are afraid to pierce it, in case he loses what gives him his fighting confidence in the first place by dwelling on his failures vs. his accomplishments. 

==Personality==
Cocky. Feels he is the hero. Feels invulnerable. Feels he couldn't possibly be wrong.

==Strategy==
Henry Kwan is well suited to melee-range mechs (such as the [[Combat Mech]] or the [[Judo Mech]]) where his special allows him position himself on tiles that would normally be blocked off to other pilots. Because flying mechs already have this ability, it is unwise to waste Kwan on them.

Contrasting with [[Prospero]]'s similar but more versatile Flying ability, Henry Kwan's Maneuverable ability does not cost Reactor Power.

==Strategy==
Hermes Engines provides high mobility and pushing utility. Unlike similar weapons such as [[Ramming Engines]], the Mech using Hermes Engines does not have to dash the entire row or column; the player can choose which tile the Mech stops on instead, offering greater control. Do note that the dash is performed in a straight line, so the Mech is limited on where it can stop, up to the tile before the first structure or unit in its path.

While Hermes Engines lacks damage, the side-push can be very helpful at repositioning multiple enemies onto hazardous terrain or away from buildings, giving it overall high resolution potential. It is also free to equip for Brute-Class Mechs; but even with a Reactor Core penalty, it's worth equipping Hermes Engines on any Mech with low movement. It is particularly effective with the pilot [[Silica]]; with Double Shot ability active, he can use Hermes Engine to move his Mech, before or after using a different weapon or repairing.

'''Hold the Door''' is one of the [[achievements]] in [[Into the Breach]], belonging to the [[Bombermechs]].

== Strategy ==
The achievement counts blocks from both mechs, walking bombs and [[Vek]], meaning that you should aim to get at your walking bomb onto a block space when possible. It requires an average of at least 3 blocks every mission to achieve, so avoid missions with alternate spawn points such as erosion points.

'''Hook Mech''' is a Brute-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Blitzkrieg]] squad.
==Strategy==
In its default Blitzkrieg squad, try using the Hook Mech as a conductor to make the [[Lightning Mech]] hit more enemies; it will only take 1 damage from a base [[Electric Whip]] in the early game, thanks to having natural Armor.

The Grappling Hook will pull movable objects (other mechs, [[Vek]] or rocks) towards it, and will pull itself towards immovable objects (such as [[Civilian Building|Civilian Buildings]], [[Mountain Tile|Mountains]] or objects and enemies that are [[Status Effects|Stable]]). The '''Shield Ally''' upgrade can be situationally useful if looking to extend the Electric Whip whip chain with an otherwise frail unit, but is not as important to get as additional movement and HP; movement will help it get the most out of Grappling Hook and position itself to create longer chains, while additional HP will be necessary for it to endure more hits when the Electric Whip weapon is upgraded.

The Hook Mech has no direct damage output, so consider purchasing a damaging [[Weapons|weapon]] for it. Alternatively, consider letting [[Kazaaakpleth]] pilot the Hook Mech, to provide it with an attack immediately through his ability. Another good pilot choice is [[Prospero]], as he can let the Hook Mech fly, allowing for better positioning and greater control.

'''Hornet''' is one of the [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
Its appearance is a wasp that moves through the air to attack using its stinger ability.

==Strategy==
Compared to other early-game Vek, the Hornet's high mobility and immunity to drowning make it more slightly dangerous than the Scarab, but it is less threatening than the Scorpion, Leaper, or Firefly since Hornets can almost always be neutralized by a single Mech.

Try to deploy your Mechs closer to the center of the board or to block chokepoints when Hornets are present, as their movement of 5 can otherwise allow them to slip out of reach into dangerous and unsolvable spots. Since its attack does not limit the target's mobility, it can be easily dodged and ignored if it targets a Mech. It should only be neutralized if it targets the grid, if it's starting to slip too far towards the back, or if no higher-threat Vek are present.

'''Hornet Leader''' is one of the Boss [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
A giant wasp that moves through the air to attack with its stinger.

==Strategy==
Unlike the regular and Alpha [[Hornet|Hornets]], the Hornet Leader is a lot less mobile at 3 move points instead of 5, making it much less likely to outmaneuver grounded mechs into tricky spots. However, it sports a large attacking threat range at 3 tiles, making it capable of dealing large amounts of grid damage in a single attack combined with its flying mobility. It's also more difficult to take out due to its high health; thus, it's best to whittle it down with a pushing attack that can redirect its large attack range into other enemies, then take it out in a subsequent turn.

In a similar vein to the [[Alpha Hornet]], it's very helpful to deploy Mechs in tight spots and narrow chokepoints near buildings against the Hornet Leader, so that it can't occupy that tile. It can also be baited by placing at least two Mechs near it in a row, as it will prioritize attacking as many targets as possible; this eases the need to neutralize it immediately if it does not target the grid.

== Basic gameplay ==

*You are outnumbered by powerful [[Vek]], but you have one key advantage: the Vek signal their attacks ahead of time. You can eliminate the danger by destroying [[Vek]] or by pushing them around on the map so that their attacks are delivered harmlessly.
*Each [[Mechs|mech]] has a set mobility that can be enhanced with [[pilots]] or new [[weapons]] and subsystems.
*Click on a weapon to use it. The number keys will also work as a shortcut. You may not move after you've shot a weapon.

== Gathering information ==

*Hover an enemy to highlight its forewarned attack.
*Hover "Attack Order" or hold Alt to see the order of effects, including environmental danger and special map effects (such as tidal waves, fire, and airstrikes).
*Hover anything and hold Ctrl to see additional information about its abilities and status.
*Click an enemy to see its movement range.

==Status effects==

* A.C.I.D.: Incoming Weapon Damage will be doubled. All other damage (Push, Fire, Blocking, etc.) is unaffected. Negates Armor.
* Fire: Takes one damage at the beginning of the enemy's turn.
*Frozen: Unit cannot move or attack. It will remain Frozen until it takes damage, moves over lava, or uses the repair ability.
*Shield: It will block damage and any negative effects (Fire, Freezing, A.C.I.D, etc.).  Only direct damage will remove the Shield. Non-damaging, negative effects will have no effect.

Negative effects can be removed by using the repair skill.

==Goals and resources==

* The game's goal is to complete at least two corporate [[islands]] and then tackle the Final Mission, the [[Volcanic Hive|Last Stand]].
*On each corporate island, you will attempt four missions (out of seven potential missions) and then fight a miniboss attacking the corporate headquarters.
*A secondary goal is the protection of the [[Grid Power|Power Grid]] that connects every island. Any damage it takes in missions will persist.  There are opportunities to restore it in gameplay, such as completing missions with a power plant (identified by a lightning symbol in addition to the normal corporate reputation rewards).  If the Grid reaches zero, the game ends.
* A building can resist damage. The chance of a building resisting damage is shown to the right of your Power Meter. If your Power Grid is full when it receives additional power, your Grid Defense will be permanently upgraded (up to +25 defense).

==Tips and tricks==
* You can attempt the Islands you've unlocked in any order.  Vek difficulty will scale depending on how many Islands you've completed in a game, with more islands meaning a more difficult experience.
* Don't be afraid to block non-lethal damage with a mech.  Mech hitpoints are a resource you should not be afraid to expend when necessary.
* Sometimes, sacrificing a point of power grid or two is worth it, particularly if you're about to finish the island. It's better than losing a pilot.
*When outnumbered, consider blocking emerging Vek with mechs, rocks, or pushed enemies. Normally this only delays the enemy's emergence, but in some cases you can prevent their emergence entirely (e.g. on the second-to-last turn, near advancing tidal waves, or on the first turn of the final battle).

==Strategy==
Hydraulic Legs provides decent damage output with great displacement and mobility, the latter being particularly useful at jumping through enemy blocked chokepoints or landing with its attack in water or smoke. The self damage is a drawback, but can be offset by many means, especially [[Viscera Nanobots]] and armor effects. [[Repair Drop]], [[Repair Field]], and [[Medical Supplies]] may also help mitigate it. If player has no access to these utilities, it's recommended to mount the mech with an [[Artificial Pilot]] and/or get +2 Health upgrade for the Mech.

The most prominent issue with Hydraulic Legs is the friendly fire potential, particularly in tight corners with buildings. While not as risky as [[Explosive Vents]] due to the positioning power, damaging allies and buildings is still a common issue with this weapon.

Hydraulic Lifter is a positionally powerful weapon, similar to [[Vice Fist]] in that it displaces the target and damages it on the tile that the target lands on, but with much more range and thus flexibility. In addition, this also triggers any terrain effects; notably, landing on [[A.C.I.D.]] pools will apply it first and then deal double damage. Desert tiles also cancel attacks as they stir up smoke, forests set Vek on [[fire]], and damaged ice tiles that crack will instantly drown grounded Vek. In the [[Cataclysm]] squad, a much stronger synergy are cracked tiles, which will insta-kill all terrestrial enemies launched onto them, as they will instantly crack and fall into chasms. Thus, powering '''+2 Range''' as early as possible is particularly recommended.

Despite the positioning benefits, the Hydraulic Lifter shares the same downsides with the Vice Fist; without environmental hazards to launch Vek onto, this weapon's damage is low at best. Also, since it requires an unoccupied spot for the target to land on, there will be situations (notably when Vek reach map borders) where this weapon will be unable to do anything to the enemy. Finally, it is unable to do anything to [[Burrower|Burrowers]] who are Stable. Due to all the possible downsides, it is recommended to complement it with an alternative weapon that deals high direct damage.

==Strategy==
Ice Generator, with maximum core investment, is arguably the best utility weapon in the game; it freezes all Veks in range, and the ice also adds one level of protection to all allied units and buildings. While it does cost a core to activate, and further cores to increase its area of effect, the fully upgraded range is so big that it's possible to freeze every living Vek on the map.

Do be mindful of Ice Generator's limited uses and where the weapon is used on though, as it also freezes the Mech, and could be fatal in missions with environmental instant-kill effects (particularly the [[Volcanic Hive]]). To mitigate the drawback of freezing the user in place, use it on top of a spawn point, with a shield equipped, external sources of repair (such as [[Repair Field]]) to remove the freeze from Mechs, or get bump damage to break the Mech free from ice. In general, the investment in reactor cores returns very well with Ice Generator; with good planning, it can carry the player through the final battle single handedly.

'''Ice Mech''' is a Ranged-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Frozen Titans]] squad.
==Strategy==
Normally, you have to use allies' or enemies' attack or block damage to free the Ice Mech from its frozen state after firing. This gives it the somewhat unique distinction of being a suitable Ranged Mech in the frontline, using the self-freeze as a pseudo-shield to tank damage. [[Camila Vera]] is a suitable pilot if playing this way, taking advantage of her immunity to webbing for flexible firing lines every turn.

However, having a pilot with a [[shield]] on the Ice Mech makes it immune to the self freezing effect of cryo-launcher and lets it drop to the back away from spawning Vek. This makes [[Bethany Jones]], [[Adam]] and in particular [[Mafan]] ideal pilots of the mech. Alternatively, for a Custom Squad, the Ice Mech can also be paired with a mech that can provide it a shield, such as the [[Defense Mech]] or [[Pulse Mech]].

Note that units standing or flying on Lava tiles are immune to being frozen, meaning the Ice Mech firing from lava won't freeze itself. This makes it effective as a regular Ranged-class mech in the fight of [[Volcanic Hive]] if playing with a pilot lacking a shield.

==Trivia==
* The Ice Mech is the only flying Mech that starts with 3 movement points.

The '''Ice''' is one of the [[Tiles]] in [[Into The Breach]].

==Notes==
If this tile takes any amount of damage, it turns into a Damaged Ice Tile.  When a Damaged Ice Tile takes any amount of damage, it turns into a [[Water Tile]].

Note that if an Ice Tile is hit with a fire effect, it will instantly turn into a Water Tile, skipping the intermediate stage.

If Damaged Ice is hit with a frozen effect, it will turn back into solid Ice. Similarly, a Water Tile that is hit with a frozen effect  will turn it into an Ice Tile.

You must control powerful [[mechs]] from the future to hold off this alien threat. Each attempt to save the world presents a new randomly generated challenge in this turn-based strategy game.

The game was released Feb 27, 2018 to Windows, Mac, and Linux, and on Aug 27, 2018 to Nintendo Switch. Ben Prunty, FTL’s composer, made the soundtrack for the game, and award-winning sound designers PowerUp Audio headed up the rest of the audio. Chris Avellone lent his writing talents and world building skills to the team as well.

==Features==
* '''Defend the Cities''': Civilian buildings power your [[mechs]]. Defend them from the [[Vek]] and watch your fire!
* '''Perfect Your Strategy''': All enemy attacks are telegraphed in minimalistic, turn-based combat. Analyze your opponent’s attack and come up with the perfect counter every turn.
* '''Build the Ultimate Mech''': Find powerful new weapons and unique pilots as you battle the Vek infestation across Corporate-Nation islands.
* '''Another Chance''': Failure is not an option. When you are defeated, send help back through time to save another timeline!

Time travel has allowed those with advanced technology to return to the past. Will you save the world this time?

The remnants of human civilization are threatened by the [[Vek]], gigantic creatures breeding beneath the earth. You must control a [[Squads|Squad]] of powerful [[Mechs]] from the future to hold off this alien threat. Each attempt to save the world presents a new randomly generated challenge in this turn-based strategy game. [[Into the Breach|more...]]

'''Isaac Jones''' is a [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach''. 
==Location==
Isaac Jones can be acquired by completing islands.

==Background==
Isaac has seen too many timelines collapse, and seen too many permutations for how things can go wrong - his high intelligence actually works against him, rather than make him more confident because he can imagine all the ways things can go wrong (think Chidi Anagonye in The Good Place). He feels ill-suited for being a soldier (his squad mates usually agree, but his scientific knowledge is indispensable). 

While he and [[Bethany Jones|Bethany]] are technically brother and sister, there hasn't been a timeline where they both were alive to realize this (either Bethany dies at a young age, or Isaac dies - only one of them could be saved in the womb b/c of a chronic medical condition their parents had). He respects machines and sees them as equals due to being raised on Pinnacle (he has faith in Zenith, perhaps too much as he feels she's too intelligent to do anything wrong).

Isaac is as much of a genius as his sister, although self-doubt weakens him. He has considerable knowledge of aeronautics, physics, gravitation theory and manipulation, and a number of other fields. It is likely Isaac could master any science he chose to, his only block is his own perceived limitations.

==Personality==
Paranoid &amp; pessimistic. Generally a good person but not handling all the stress well, and his attitude can sometimes be demoralizing - he's suspicious of his own successes and victories. Definitely a "this timeline's already half-lost" kind of guy. Stutters because of temporal research studies... it's caused a nervous system problem in his speech patterns.

==Strategy==
Having an additional [[Reset Turn]] can be quite invaluable in rectifying a mistake or experimenting with options. However, veteran players will not normally have to use this feature, at which point Isaac Jones is less relevant.

There are situational uses where an additional [[Reset Turn]] ability is useful to strategy. All buildings have a shared chance to resist damage based on your [[Grid Defense]], determined by a hidden random number that is generated and seeded at the start of each timeline.&lt;ref name = "building_resistance_dev_comment"&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/IntoTheBreach/comments/9aowo9/comment/e4x0rtj/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3]Dev comment on building resistance based on a seeded random number&lt;/ref&gt; While this value is hidden from the player and resisting damage is most useful on the Vek's move when it is too late to Reset, you can check if a resist will trigger on your turn from:
* intentionally targeting your own buildings
* pushing an opponent/object into a building
* an [[Abilities and status effects|Explosive decay]] actor exploding on death

Note that this value carries over to subsequent maps in the same timeline until a building gets hit. The player can continue hitting buildings, making note of which attacks were resisted, and reset; after the reset, the exact same resist order will play out as buildings get damaged. Increasing Grid Defense '''can''' change the outcome if the resist value is higher than the seeded number; in other words, a resist can still be possible with the same seed later in the run, when Grid Defense percentage is increased. &lt;ref name = "resist_video_explanation"&gt;[https://youtu.be/-8h8yEG5f-8]Video explanation: Guaranteed Grid Resist&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, Isaac Jones additional Reset Turn makes this strategy less risky, though it still relies on luck to successfully manipulate the number to the players favor; see "[[Grid_Power#Resists_&amp;_Resets|Fish for Resists]]" for more information.

With the [[Advanced Edition]], the additional Reset Turn can benefit the pilot [[Adam]] by allowing an additional activation of his Chosen One ability per battle. However, this combo requires finding at least one of those pilots per playthrough.

The '''Islands''' in ''[[Into The Breach]]'' is where humanity's last stand takes place. At the beginning of each new timeline, each of the four islands are randomly generated with different region names, terrains, and bonus objectives. The only consistent variable is their biome, the region layout, and the controlling corporation.  
 
Each island is divided into eight regions. One region is always the Corporate HQ. The other seven regions are available for missions. Completing four missions triggers an attack on the Corporate HQ and locks out the remaining three regions. 
 
There are four main islands that the player must liberate from the Vek to win. After saving two islands, the Volcanic Hive island becomes available, where the final battle can be fought to save the world from the Vek. 
 
* Museum Island ([[Archive, Inc.]]): Recreates Old Earth as it was before the oceans rose and nearly wiped out humanity.
* Desert Island ([[R.S.T. Corporation]]): Terraforming specialists, R.S.T. turned the environment against the Vek and nearly destroyed their Island in the process.
* Ice Island ([[Pinnacle Robotics]]):Pinnacle Robotics fights a war on two fronts, one against the Vek, the other against its own Sentient Weapons.
* Factory Island ([[Detritus Disposal]]): Detritus tech can break down any matter into its base elements. Their factory-cities are devoted to waste removal and recycling.
* [[Volcanic Hive]]

==Strategy==
Janus Cannon is basically a two-way [[Taurus Cannon]], shooting the exact same projectile with the same damage in two directions. It does have a cheaper damage upgrade price though, with its first '''+1 Damage''' upgrade costing 1 Reactor Core.

Shooting two projectiles is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it provides some resolution potential for hitting multiple targets, though it still requires some luck with enemies lining up favorably. On the other hand, it can often lead to friendly fire against allies and grid buildings, so caution must be taken to prevent that. To mitigate the latter, deploying the Mech that is using Janus Cannon in an open row and column is recommended, or alternatively using other Mechs with equipment such as [[Shield|shields]] to body block the second projectile. This is especially important with webbing enemies in play to prevent situations that could lead to friendly fire while breaking out of webs.

{{quote|One of your 'Time Pods' has appeared on sensors. Perhaps this one will shed truth on why you're really here.}}
[[Jessica Kern]] is the C.E.O. of [[R.S.T. Corporation]]. A pragmatic and ruthless leader, she is not as amiable to the arrival of the Mechs and is immediately suspicious, but welcomes their aid in defeating the [[Vek]].

* "You completed every mission on R.S.T. despite the odds. You've earned my respect, #squad - and everything we can offer."
|-
|Welcome_Message
|Upon arriving to the island and being greeted.
|
*"My advisors insist we're losing the fight. They also insist I trust you. And since those cowards rarely insist I do anything, I'm giving you a chance to prove yourselves."
*"Don't think for a moment I'm falling for the 'time traveler' stories, but your Mechs - they are undeniably impressive."
*"You won't find me as gullible as my department heads. Whatever 'time traveler' nonsense you claim, it's your firepower we need."
*"We can postpone the discussion on where you got this advanced weaponry until after you use it."
*"R.S.T. was divided on asking you for help; it was viewed as weakness. But the choice is stark: we either ally with you or lose the island."
|-
|Mission_ExtremeDamage
|After finishing a mission with more than 3 grid buildings destroyed. Overridden by failed bonus objectives, overrides normal success messages. 
|
*"I've seen the casualty reports from your mission. The losses... were considerable. But not unendurable."
*"My staff reports your attacks are hurting us more than the Vek - but keep hammering them, no matter what it takes."
*"I fired my advisors after they objected to the collateral damage on this mission. War means people die - it's that or we lose the planet."
* "Many died today - too many. But the ends justify the means when you see the end coming for you."
*"The loss of life in the last battle - it is better than losing the planet. We must all make sacrifices."
*"My people understand their sacrifices are not in vain. We must keep the pressure on, or everyone will die."
|-
|Mission_Generic_Briefing
|Briefing pre-mission with generic bonus objectives.
| 
*"Our island suffered greatly when we turned our terraforming tech against the Vek. Still, we must defend what's left."
*"The civilians in those buildings are tough, but not invincible. Make sure they survive this fight."
*"Grind the Vek into the dirt they're breeding in. If your story of the future is true, they must be stopped here and now."
|-
|Mission_Generic_Success 
|Succeeding in a generic mission with all bonus objectives. 
|
*"That's the spirit we need if we're going to win this fight. Good work, both you and your... '#squad'."
*"Excellent, you've gained ground - we'll hold it now; you and your squad keep advancing."
*"Never thought we'd dig the Vek out - wherever you're from, I hope there's more of you on the way."
*"I read the casualty reports, and it's my pleasure to report the Vek are in the top percentile."
*"Region is secure. Deploying troops to hold the area before the weather shifts."
|-
|Mission_Generic_Failure
| Failing one of the bonus objectives in a generic mission (needs verification)
|
*"We don't have anywhere to retreat. If you think we can run, you're wrong. This is all we have."
*"Your best isn't good enough. We need better."
*"If you can't use your weapons to win this fight, then surrender them to someone who can."
|-
|Mission_Mechs_Dead
|Losing a region because of all mechs being disabled
|
*"The war won't be determined by this battle - but a few more like this, and it might be. We can't afford any more losses."
*"One lost battle doesn't lose the war - but we can't continue to lose ground. You need to focus." 
|-
|Mission_MechHealth_Briefing
|Briefing of a mech damage mission
| 
*"We can barely keep our cities functioning, let alone repair your Mechs if they are damaged. Choose your shots carefully."
*"This isn't Pinnacle - we don't have enough engineering crews to fix your Mechs if they take heavy damage."
|-
| Mission_MechHealth_Success
|Completion of mech damage mission
|
*"I see you and the #squad weathered the worst of it and survived. Excellent."
*"The repair teams report barely a scratch on your Mechs - efficiently done. We can re-allocate the damage control teams to civilian relief and city protection."
*"Your Mechs took almost no damage. That means we can allocate additional resources and repair crews to help refugee centers elsewhere on R.S.T."
|-
|Mission_MechHealth_Failure
|Failure of mech damage mission
|
*"Your Mechs are heavily damaged; several teams of engineers have been reassigned to repairing them as we speak, even the teams devoted to civilian defense."
*"The damage to your Mechs is extensive - we'll have to call in repair crews from the city centers if we're going to stay in the fight. And we must stay in the fight."
*"Your Mechs are so torn up they're ready for the scrapyard. It'll take our repair crews working double shifts to get them back in fighting shape!"
*"We've had to call back engineers from the refugee centers to fix the damage to your '#squad'. Don't let this happen again."

| Mission_GridHealth_Briefing
|Briefing of a grid health mission
|
* "The Grid here can barely power your Mechs. Fight efficiently, or you'll be in the red faster than you think."

|-
|Mission_GridHealth_Failure

|
* "Many lives were lost today... if this continues, there'll be no more of my people to protect."
* "The Grid took massive damage, and the casualties... unacceptable. I need you to protect my people, not let them be slaughtered!"
* "Did you come from the future to ruin us? The Grid is damaged, we have no idea if we can repair it - and the casualty reports? They're still coming in."
|-
|Mission_KillAll_Briefing
|Briefing of kill enemies mission
|
* "Don't let a single Vek survive - if they do, they'll only create another hive and hit us again.  Kill them all."
* "Exterminate every Vek - if you don't, we'll be fighting this same battle again in a few days. Don't let a single one escape."
* "Keep firing until every Vek is dead - then shoot them again. Do not allow even one to escape, or they'll swarm us again in days."
|-
|Mission_KillAll_Success
|Completion of kill enemies mission
|
* "One less Vek swarm to worry about. I've read the battle reports - I'm impressed. You and the #squad were very thorough in the extermination."
* "Your thoroughness in battlefield sanitation is appreciated. Sweeper teams report no Vek survived."
* "First, we burn the Vek on the surface, then we'll dig below and exterminate them like you did here."
|-
|Mission_KillAll_Failure
|Failure of kill enemies mission
|
* "You let some Vek  escape? Unacceptable - you haven't won, you've merely delayed the fight."
* "If you can't contain an area and cleanse it of the Vek, I'll find someone who can."
* "Sweeper teams already report the surviving Vek have burrowed too deep to hit - likely making  another hive."
* "I needed a thorough Vek cleansing, not a half-assed attempt."
* "I thought I was clear - all the Vek have to die. Every. Single. One."

==In-Mission==
*"Now show me what those Mechs of yours can do."
*"What was that? Just had a moment of deja vu... like when you first arrived."
*Emerging Vek
** "Seismic readings are spiking. More Vek will be here soon.",
**"Watch the ground, we're detecting increased subterranean Vek activity."
**"The Vek have reached topside. They'll be more trouble now."
**"The Vek impede their own.",
**"That Vek has blocked the other. Stupid creatures.",
**"If only I could block every emerging Vek with another."
*On Vek
**"May the aquatic life feed on that Vek's corpse.",
**"If you can't kill the Vek with your weapons, water will suffice."
**"We'll send a team to dig the Vek out later to make sure it's dead.",
**"Better to kill the Vek where our sensors can confirm it... but the fall should kill the Vek."
**"The smoke disorients the Vek, makes them easy targets."
**"Now that the Vek's frozen, don't let it break free."
** "Vek kill their own. Such stupid creatures.",
** "Mindless beasts... the Vek can't even stop themselves from killing each other."
*Building Hit
**"Careless. That building should have been protected!",
**"Your incompetency will result in hundreds of deaths!",
**"We need you to defend those buildings!",
**"It is unacceptable to let the Vek succeed. Stop them!",
**"You're there to stop the Vek, not watch them destroy the city.",
**"The Grid held. You got lucky this time.",
** "The Power Grid's defense is unreliable at best. But it worked this time, that building held.",

*On Pilot Death
**"Another life the Vek will answer for.",
**"We will make the Vek pay for your pilot's sacrifice."
**"No matter how many machines the Vek destroy, we will find a way to make more. We must.",
**"That Mech is now useless.",
**"The loss of that Mech is why mechanized pilots can never compare to human pilots."
*Mission Success 
**"Every Vek has been wiped out. Thorough - and impressive.",
** "Excellent work. That is all."
**"Hard to believe, but it appears you drove them off."
**"While I would have preferred you kill all the Vek, the region is secure, and that is enough."
**"You've proven yourself in the field, [[Pilots|Pilot]]. But to prove yourself to me, you'll have to save R.S.T. first.",
** "Perhaps I underestimated you, Officer [[Pilots|Pilot]]. I think you could teach our cadets how best to fight the Vek."

== Pod==
*"Another Pod from 'your future' is incoming.",
*"One of your 'Time Pods' has appeared on sensors. Perhaps this one will shed truth on why you're really here."
* "That Pod's technically company property, so make sure it gets back intact.",
*"I want that Pod retrieved... and if you can't retrieve in during the battle, keep the Vek from it.",
*"If only those Pods would hit a Vek on the way down.",
*"Those Pods are falling from the skies... suspicious."
*"Careless."
* "Now that you've made recovering the Pod impossible, focus on the mission."

==R.S.T. Missions==
*Train
** "Our maglev's crippled, but can be repaired. Keep it from taking any more damage."
**"Our maglev's destroyed. A waste.",
**"Careless."
*Terraform
**"Stay out of the terraformer's way and let it do its work.",
**"Use the terraformer to kill the Vek if you have to... it's an effective weapon."
**"Report to my office about that terraformer as soon as you're back.",
**"About that terraformer... make my office the first stop when you return to base.",
**"Terraformer's offline. Careless."
*Cataclysm
**"Watch the terrain... R.S.T. is continually shifting and breaking apart.",
**"Knock the Vek into the chasms if you can - the fall will kill them."
*Storm
**"Even storms hate the Vek...",
**"That's why we harness the weather against the Vek. It's quite effective."
*Solar
**"I'll see to it you apologize to the R.S.T. families personally.",
**"We needed those farms!",
**"Solar farm's been destroyed. Careless."
*Mountains
**"You have your orders. Those mountains need to come down.",
**"If those mountains remain standing, the Vek will use them as a staging ground for more attacks.",
**"Direct your fire on the mountains! We can't let them be used as hives."
*Bombs
**"This site holds two warheads designed by a temporal physicist, Dr. Renfield, utilizing your 'breach' technology. R.S.T. was deemed the safest place to test them."
**"Excellent, both prototypes survived intact. I can order Renfield and his team to move on to stage two."
**"While you lost one of Renfield's prototypes, at least the other is intact. But your carelessness could cost us the war."
**"Your incompetence knows no bounds. Not one, but both of Renfield's prototypes destroyed... you may have cost us the war!"


==Secret==
*"Our sensors are picking up strange readings from that mountain that was destroyed. Investigate if you can."
*"Our sensors are picking up strange readings from beneath that layer of ice. Investigate if you can."
*"Sensors have picked up an unidentified craft descending on your location."

==The Last Stand==
*"Deploying remote power pylons. They'll keep you connected to the Grid."
*"Incoming seismic activity. Brace yourselves."
*"Sending down power pylons. Keep them operational, we don't have any more."
*"Deploying a Renfield Bomb. Defend it while it primes and it will destroy the hive."
**"Deploying another bomb, but it will need more time to prime. Try to keep this one in one piece."
*"The Renfield bomb is ready. I recommend you leave now or you'll share a grave with the Vek."

==Defeat==
*"The Power Grid has collapsed! We've failed!",
*"You've failed to protect the Grid! R.S.T.... all the islands... we're finished!",
*"The Grid has collapsed! The Vek are swarming the island!"
*"The Vek are erupting across the islands... if you can get to safety, do so.",
*"If you are time travelers, then prove it. There is nothing more here.",
*"It is over. Escape if you can... I will die here, with my people."

==Victory==
*"My trust in you was not misplaced. You were tested, and you prevailed."</text>

'''Jet Mech''' is a Brute-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Rusting Hulks]] squad.
==Strategy==
Remember that [[Abilities_and_status_effects#List_of_terrain_effects|Smoke]] cancels enemy attacks, so even if the Jet Mech can't kill a Vek, it can stop it from doing any damage. In the Rusting Hulks squad, keep in mind that electric smoke will also passively damage and eventually kill worn down enemy Vek.

Due to the leaping nature of the Jet Mech's attack requiring an empty tile to land on, it is easy to get stuck in Smoke itself. Therefore, [[Camila_Vera|Camilla Vera]] can be an excellent choice for a pilot.

Utilizing the Jet Mech’s ability to launch itself over Vek can be invaluable for both damaging enemies and improving its position for subsequent turns, particularly with '''+1 Range''' upgraded. By attacking from different angles and at different distances, it can quickly gain the advantage using the smoke to cancel enemy attacks and restrict their movement, as enemies will avoid moving into Smoke if they have other options.

The Jet Mech does well staying close to Vek spawns thanks to its direct attack utility and high starting movement, but it can also be quite frail at 2 HP to start. Consider increasing it as soon as it is feasible, as this will also allow it to land on spawn points more freely after it attacks.

Under a Custom Squad, the Jet Mech can be used alongside the [[Smog Mech]] as well; the smoke it leaves behind can be used with Nanofilter Mending to repair it and other mechs, including repairing disabled mechs to revive them.

'''Judo Mech''' is a Prime-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Steel Judoka]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Judo Mech is useful for moving Vek away from buildings and preventing any damage done to them, as well as completely redirecting attacks against other enemies. With it's additional armor, it can be used to block attacks altogether. The pilot [[Abe Isamu|Abe Isamu's]] ability is wasted on this mech.

Investing in more Mech movement early on is recommended for the Judo Mech; since the Vice Fist weapon needs an unoccupied tile behind the Mech to be able to fire, more movement will allow the Judo Mech more flexibility for where it wants to throw enemies. In particular, look for tiles that can activate environment effects, such as a [[Forest Tile]]; the damage from Vice Fist will trigger the effect on the tile as well.

Upgrading Vice Fist is generally not a priority. The '''Ally Immune''' upgrade is extremely situational to be worth it; in theory, it could help with repositioning ally units away from harm, but in practice, it is usually better to reposition the enemies themselves. The '''+2 Damage''' upgrade could help it kill an enemy, if throwing enemies into [[A.C.I.D. Pool|A.C.I.D. Pools]]; this is more useful if using the Judo Mech in a [[Custom Squad]] that can consistently provide A.C.I.D. though. In the Steel Judoka, it is not always beneficial to kill enemies with direct damage, as repositioning them into other enemy attacks can often be sufficient thanks to [[Vek Hormones]].

Regardless of where this Mech is used, Vice Fist can only target enemies if there's space behind the Judo Mech to throw them, and is still completely unable to damage enemies in tight corners. Additionally, it is unable to target stable units, most notably [[Burrower|Burrowers]]. To circumvent this weakness, it's recommended to invest on a secondary weapon that can deal direct damage without grabbing the enemy. The pilot [[Kazaaakpleth]] can be alternatively equipped on the Judo Mech to provide this through his ability.

In a Custom Squad, the Judo Mech may be used with the [[Leap Mech]] as well, and have them swap their weapons around; the innate armor for the Judo Mech will prevent the initial self-damage from [[Hydraulic Legs]]. This does, however, leave the Leap Mech with the less useful Vice Fist weapon, so consider equipping Kazaaakpleth or [[Harold Schmidt]] on the Leap Mech if trying this combination for a Custom Squad.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach'' introduced in the Advanced Edition. She is only obtainable in-game if advanced equipment is on at the start of a timeline, but can be used with the option off if she is a time traveller from a previous timeline or a starting pilot.
==Location==
Kai Miller can be unlocked from time pods or by perfect island rewards when advanced equipment is turned on.

==Background==
==Personality==
==Strategy==
Universally one of the best pilots, Kai Miller can grant a much-needed damage boost to squads that lack it. She can be placed onto ranged mechs to prevent the risk of losing the boost, or into prime mechs for extra firepower on the front lines if you can keep it from taking damage. However, Kai's ability discourages blocking as the mech would have to waste a turn to repair and get the boost back. The '''Masochist''' skill will make up for the reduced movement in the case that the boost is lost. While '''Technician''' seems to be a good skill it only heals during the enemy turn and not the player's, making it unable to immediately repair damage after a block.

Be careful with weapons that inflict self-damage, as the boost status effect increases it as well. For example, Kai on the Charge Mech with a boost will deal 3 damage to the target and 2 damage to herself. Without a reliable way to repair the additional self-damage dealt, it is not advised to let Kai use said weapons as it will undo the boost and suffer a move penalty.

Certain squad recommendations include:

* [[Blitzkrieg]] - Having her on the [[Lightning Mech]] effectively makes the first island free from any normal Vek. Be careful though, as the [[Hook Mech]] will take two damage and will not be as reliable of a lightning whip conductor.
* [[Steel Judoka]] -  Having her on the [[Siege Mech]] is lets it kill a three-health enemy on the first island with one attack.
* [[Arachnophiles]] - Having her on the [[Arachnoid Mech]] saves having to invest two cores into the +1 Damage upgrade.
* [[Mist Eaters]] - Losing the boost from the [[Thruster Mech]]'s self-damage can be undone by feeding it smoke.
* [[Cataclysm]] - Allows the [[Drill Mech]] to immediately do two damage from the start of the game.

'''Kazaaakpleth''' is a secret [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach''. 
==Location==
Kazaaakpleth, along with the other secret pilots [[Mafan]] and [[Ariadne]], is only obtainable in a run through the following process:

# Find a [[Marked mountain tile|marked mountain or ice tile]], which can be identified after entering a mission through a small glowing dot and being damaged by 1 point prematurely.
# Break the tile and collect the beacon by moving onto it with a mech or allied unit.
# After ending the turn, a '''Strange Pod''' will drop. Protecting it rewards one of the secret pilots and a reactor core.

Once unlocked, Kazaaakpleth can be used as a starting pilot without doing the above method again.

==Background==
The Mantis are an alien race from the game ''FTL: Faster Than Light'' by Subset Games, the same developers behind Into the Breach. Due to their alien nature, generic text is used to streamline him and other secret pilots for use in-game. His full name is KazaaakplethKilik, a legendary Mantis thief. 

General Background: The Mantis exist to expand, loot, and plunder. There are males and females of the species. They once enslaved the Engi (and thus, may have an overseer-like dominance toward their Mech). They are expansionist, tribal, warlike, and polytheistic. Females often don't make it to high positions of authority unless they are particularly vicious.

At key points in their life, they have to either return home to reform their exoskeletons (non-biological materials adhere to a resin secreted by their epidermal layers) - or to a suitable planet with the same materials. The Earth of Into the Breach is one such planet, although it's not clear if the Mantis were aware of that. Their ships are composed of the same crust that the Mantis "wear." Presumably this crust can be applied to Mech hulls as well (not planning to discuss/show in game, merely commenting this). Mantis ship hulls may also be bedecked with hides, corpses, and remains of their kills. The Mantis enjoy teleporter technology in hunting prey (teleporting onto ships) and are comfortable with the technology (but the Breach tech may be more primitive than they're used to).

Kazaaakpleth is feared among his own people because he doesn't hunt aliens... he prefers to hunt his own kind. He outwardly claims to be doing this for bounties and for a higher, noble purpose, but secretly, he enjoys killing other Mantis. His craft is an escape pod from a failed encounter with a tribe of his own people he'd marked for death. His craft detected the beacon from Earth, and followed it to the corporate islands. He soon relalized he'd come to the "Happy Hunting Grounds" a place where he can practice his fighting skills on larger varities of insects than ever (the Vek) and a mech he can use as a weapon. Kazaaakpleth is happy to slay as many Vek as he can, although if he had the skill to build a ship and take to the stars with the technology he has found, he would do so. Like other Mantis, Kazaakpleth needs to reestablish his carapace and he finds the islands rich with suitable biological material - including Vek corpses.

==Personality==
Mantis speak in a kind of chittering - (i.e. names having a lot of k's or tch's kinda sounds).

==Strategy==

* Kazaaakpleth is a great way of provide fighting power to mechs that don't have it, mainly science mechs and the [[Hook Mech]]. His ability to neutralise enemies is better than [[Harold Schmidt]] as the mantis special can easily kill and control the map better; rarely will Harold out-pace him, such as when surrounded by multiple Vek.
* Kazaaakpleth prevents the mech he pilots from healing himself and thus carries a high risk of losing him early, especially on science mechs with two health like the [[Defense Mech]]. He must stay away from fire and blocking spawns as much as possible.
* Some mechs like the [[Judo Mech]] have limiting positional requirements for their attack, the Judo Mech in particular being unable to do anything if the tile behind is occupied. Kazaaakpleth's attack can be used anytime, which can increase their options for attack.

== Trivia ==

* The mantis ability closely matches the behaviour of mantises in FTL. Mantises in FTL are excellent in combat but have poor repairing skills, which translate over to an offensive attack replacing the ability to heal.

'''Large Blob''' is one of the Boss [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==

A massive sized gelatinous ooze resembling a similar [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatinous_cube fictional monster]. This boss Vek can only appear in corporate islands with the "Defeat 5 Goos" objective alongside the HQ mission objective, and is excluded from the [[Volcanic Hive]].

When defeated, the Large Goo will split into 2 [[Medium Goo|Medium Goos]]; when a Medium Goo is defeated, it will split into 2 [[Small Goo|Small Goos]]. The resulting enemies that come from the split will be launched and land on randomly determined tiles that the game determines as safe (i.e. avoiding tiles like fire and water, though still possibly landing in range of another enemy's attack). The split happens immediately after the Large or Medium Goo is defeated. The tiles they land on is determined at that moment based on the player Mechs placements, and can change after a [[Reset Turn]] is used and the Goo is defeated again if the Mechs are placed on different tiles.

==Strategy==
This Vek can be a challenge to deal with for those who cannot effectively manage large groups of enemies. While it has low health in it's starting phase, it soon splits into two smaller versions of itself when defeated. The two Medium Goos will then split into even smaller goos on death; not taking care of each Goo size quickly can leave the player with four enemies to fight alongside the other Vek. Wide Area of Effect damage, or Mechs like the [[Flame Behemoths]] who use the Vek's lack of self preservation to their advantage, are effective for this boss fight.

'''Laser-Bot''' is one of the  [[Sentient Weapons]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==

A cylindrical shaped quadreped robot carrying two laser shooting scopes, one on each side.

==Strategy==

In general, the low health of Sentient Weapons makes them easy to take out with any attack or collateral damage from bumping [[Vek]] into them.

The challenging part comes when they must be kept alive in some objectives to claim reputation; in these cases, smoking or displacing them with non-damaging weapons is recommended, until they can be safely frozen. Just like the [[Laser Mech]], their penetrating lasers allow them to pierce any units in its path until it hits a structure such as a building or mountain. If they must be defended and can't be frozen right away, use smoke or displacement to avoid grid damage.

'''Laser-Mech''' is one of the Alpha [[Sentient Weapons]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==

A cylindrical shaped quadreped robot carrying two laser shooting scopes, one on each side.

==Strategy==

In general, the low health of Sentient Weapons makes them easy to take out with any attack or collateral damage from bumping [[Vek]] into them.

The challenging part comes when they must be kept alive in some objectives to claim reputation; in these cases, smoking or displacing them with non-damaging weapons is recommended, until they can be safely frozen. Just like the [[Laser Mech]], their penetrating lasers allow them to pierce any units in its path until it hits a structure such as a building or mountain. If they must be defended and can't be frozen right away, use smoke or displacement to avoid grid damage.

'''Laser Mech''' is a Prime-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Zenith Guard]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Laser Mech's Burst Beam fires in a straight line, indiscriminately damaging anything in its path until it hits an obstacle such as a building or mountain. The laser deals the most damage in the first target hit, decreasing by 1 point of damage with further tiles. The '''ally immunity''' upgrade can be unlocked to prevent damaging other Mechs, but it does not grant immunity to structures.

In terms of raw damage, Burst Beam is the most powerful default loadout weapon available to any mech in the game; it deals 3 points of damage on the first tile hit alone, which lets the Laser Mech dispose of any common enemy and gives it a particularly strong early-game. Despite that, it is wise to invest in a secondary weapon that has more controlled range, using it when firing Burst Beam would otherwise damage buildings. Alternatively, if using Advanced Equipment, [[Refractor Laser]] can replace Burst Beam if found, as it essentially offers the same benefits with more controlled range, more potential damage, with a minimal trade-off requiring 1 extra reactor power in cost.

Due to the friendly fire potential, particularly in the early-game, the Laser Mech greatly benefits from pilots that can offer it more mobility and positioning options. A good option includes [[Camila Vera]], as the Mech often finds itself near enemies; the immunity to webbing is helpful at baiting those enemies while allowing the Mech to fire from a more favorable spot. In the late-game, when more Alpha enemies are in play, a pilot that offers a [[Boosted|Boost]] will also help the Laser Mech hit for 5 damage with Burst Beam, assuming a better weapon isn't found by then.

==Trivia==
The Laser Mech bears a vague resemblance to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_(mecha)#Metal_Gear_REX Metal Gear REX] model from the ''Metal Gear'' series.

'''Leap Mech''' is a Prime-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Hazardous Mechs]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Leap Mech has the most flexible movement of any Prime class Mech, thanks to its starting mobility of 4, and Hydraulic Legs letting it leap over obstacles and enemies. Unlike other Prime class Mechs, the Leap Mech can afford to be deployed in the back rows right from the early-game, due to its attack allowing it to launch itself immediately from turn 1 towards the front, all while pushing ''and'' damaging multiple threats at once. It is also possible for the Leap Mech to use Hydraulic Legs to land on Smoke or Water tiles, whilst still attacking enemies next to them. All of these benefits gives the Leap Mech a lot of flexible firing angles.

However, despite its excellent mobility and resolution potential, the Leap Mech is not without its flaws. Firstly, Hydraulic Legs also causes self-damage; this is not an issue in the Hazardous Mechs, where [[Viscera Nanobots]] can let it remain active as long as it kills at least one target. In a [[Custom Squad]], though, if Leap Mech is not paired with another Mech such as the [[Smog Mech]] or other destruction prevention mechanics, it requires a pilot such as [[Abe Isamu]] or [[Ariadne]] to prevent its drawback, or alternatively a previous time traveller with the [[Skills#Advanced_Edition|Technician]] ability so they can Repair every turn. Dismounting the pilot and operating the Mech with the [[Artificial Pilot]] can work too, but is less ideal. As long as the self-damage drawback from Hydraulic Legs is prevented or mitigated, the '''+1 Damage Each''' upgrade is recommended to get first, so that the Leap Mech can kill and resolve as many enemies as possible.

The second issue is that the Self-Damage, even with a Pilot or Mech that can repair or prevent it, will still damage the tile that the Leap Mech lands on as well; the only way for this to be prevented is to have it [[Shield|shielded]], be it through a support weapon from another Mech or with a pilot such as [[Mafan]]. Otherwise, unless the Leap Mech is paired with an immunity to fire, avoid landing it's attack on forest tiles, as the self-damage will light it on fire. The same is true with cracked tiles without a shield; unless the mech is equipped with [[Prospero]] to fly, the tile will crack and the Leap Mech will fall into the chasm. It will similarly destroy any [[Time Pod|time pods]] that it lands on, unless it is equipped with a shield to absorb the self-damage (and collect it instead in this case).

The third, and most prominent issue, is that the Leap Mech is very prone to committing friendly fire; Hydraulic Legs targets 4 tiles in the same way that [[Cluster Artillery]] does, but it lacks an upgrade for Buildings Immune. Thus, it's ideal to occupy tiles in tight corners with your own units, or block enemies from moving onto them altogether.

In summary, while the Leap Mech does have great resolution and positioning potential, it requires Mechs or Pilots that synergize with it to counter its drawbacks so that it can be a potent Mech.

The '''Leaper''' is a [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
Leapers jump to their destination and avoid all obstacles in the way. After they move they will web an adjacent target and prepare to stab it during the enemy turn for 3 damage.

Leapers cannot spawn alongside the [[Scorpion]].

==Strategy==
Leapers are dangerous due to their webbing, high damage, and high mobility, but their low health makes them trivial for most starting Mechs to kill. Try to stay out of their movement range whenever possible, as it will force them to waste their web ability on grid buildings. Eliminate them as soon as you are able; preferably using collateral bump damage, or by moving another Vek to attack them.

The Light Tank is one of the [[weapons#Deployables|deployable tanks]] in the game [[Into the Breach]]. It can be found in a [[Time Pod]] or as a Reputation reward.

==Description==
Deploy a small tank to help in combat. Single-use.

The Light Tank starts with 1 HP and 3 move points. It shoots a projectile that does no damage and pushes the target.

===Class===
Any.

===Upgrades===
* '''+2 Health''' (1 Reactor Core {{template:1power}}) - Increases the Tank's max health to 3.
* '''+2 Damage''' (3 Reactor Cores {{template:3power}}) - Increases the Tank's attack damage to 2.

==Strategy==
All four of the tank-as-weapon variants are limited to 3 movement, and are generally much weaker than a Mech. However, they can offer a crucial 4th action per turn, along with another unit to bait enemy Vek into attacking instead of Grid Buildings.

On harder difficulty levels, the major challenge is finding a turn has enough slack to deploy the tank rather than using the Mech's (typically more powerful) primary weapon. Once the Tank is out, subsequent turns become much easier.

The value of the Light Tank lies in its ability to provide a vital push to a far-away target right when it is deployed. The '''+2 Health''' upgrade should be considered sooner rather than later, as it allows it to block spawns for consecutive turns without sacrifice. Out of all the deployable tanks, the Light Tank is the most expensive to upgrade fully, thanks to the '''+2 Damage''' upgrade; this upgrade should be considered eventually, if playing with a Squad that appreciates the additional damage output provided by a 4th unit. More damage isn't always better though; the initial 0 damage projectile has valuable utility of its own too, such as pushing other ally units away from danger – [[Mine-Bot|Mine-Bots]] for example – as well as [[Frozen]] enemies without cracking them.

'''Lightning Mech''' is a Prime-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''. Mech's primary weapon, [[Electric Whip]], lets the Mech to channel great amounts of damage throughout the whole battlefield, if properly positioned. 
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Blitzkrieg]] squad.
==Strategy==
The key to using the Lightning Mech is positioning it next to [[Civilian Building|buildings]], as melee [[Vek]] will prioritize attacking buildings and Mechs adjacent to them. This will allow the Electric Whip current to flow through as many targets as possible. For this reason, it is greatly recommended to use a [[Reactor Core]] and power the '''Building Chain''' upgrade as soon as possible. Additionally, it's encouraged to use other Mechs to extend the circuit; in the Blitzkrieg Squad, the Hook Mech has natural Armor, which makes it an effective conductor. The current even flows through disabled Mechs.

Be wary of the objects you are ought to protect, such as [[Disposal Unit]], [[Supply Train]], [[Renfield Bomb]] or its Prototypes. If they are part of the circuit, they will be damaged by the Whip, because they are not Buildings. The current flows in all possible directions, so if you discharge the whip at a T-junction, it will go both ways. The current doesn't flow through Mountains, but does flow through Rocks left by [[Rock Accelerator]] or [[Digger|Diggers]].

One of the best pilots for the Lightning Mech is [[Silica]], who will allow the Lighning Mech to use Electric Whip twice in one turn once his Double Shot ability is active; with fully upgraded damage, this will allow the Mech to hit every enemy for 3 + 3 damage in one turn, which is enough damage to take out every enemy besides the [[Scorpion Leader]] and [[Centipede Leader]]. Another decent choice is [[Rosie Rivets]]; since Electric Whip relies on friendly fire, she can move next to a disabled ally and revive it.

| caption = Finish the first 2 Corporate Islands in under 30 minutes with the Blitzkrieg squad
}}
'''Lightning War''' is one of the [[Achievements]] in [[Into the Breach]].

== Strategy ==
Your main priority for getting this achievement is to clear missions as fast as possible, while keeping enemy actions as low as possible and your [[Grid Power]] high enough. Only the first two Islands (any two of them) need to be completed for this achievement to trigger. Neither successfully achieving bonus objectives or winning the game are required.

Since you'll be playing quickly, it is likely that [[Corporate Reputation|Reputation]] will be scarce after completing the 1st island, so familiarize yourself with the [[Blitzkrieg|Blitzkrieg Squad]]'s abilities and positioning specifics before attempting to get this achievement.

=== Preparing ===
When you are ready, tweak the following settings under the Options menu:
* Turn on the timer. This will allow you to track the time left.
* Turn up enemy movement speed all the way. This will save a lot of time between turns.

The achievement itself is based on the in-game timer. It stops when you enter the pause menu (press {{Key|Esc}}). If you use a reset, the timer will be rolled back to the beginning of the turn as well.

Particularly helpful pilots to start the timeline with;
* [[Kazaaakpleth]] to give the [[Hook Mech]] a much needed offensive option, which speeds up clearing Vek.
* [[Camila Vera]] with the [[Lightning Mech]], as being immune to [[Webbing]] and [[Smoke]] helps speed up deployment to bait webbing Vek. If Camila has an extra [[Reactor Core|Core]], spend it on the '''Building Chain''' upgrade immediately.

While not impossible, it is very difficult to get this achievement on Hard and Unfair. Consider turning down the [[Difficulty]] to Easy.

=== During Gameplay ===
You have 10 missions (4 generic missions + defending the HQ on each island) to complete in under 30 minutes, which roughly estimates to 3 minutes per mission.

To minimize the amount of time spent per mission, you'll want to limit enemy activity as much as possible, as this is where most of the time wasted goes. Block emerging Vek as much as possible, taking advantage of the Rock Accelerator; the less enemies that spawn, the fewer enemy actions there are to go through on their turn.

Hover your mouse cursor over an island to see the enemies. In particular, consider avoiding islands that have the following enemies;
* [[Blast Psion]], as the explosive decay effect spends several seconds per turn exploding each enemy on death, and can waste a lot of time added together if it isn't taken out fast enough.
* [[Smoldering Psion]] if using Advanced Edition content. In a similar vein to the Blast Psion, the Smoldering Psion also causes enemies to explode in flames after dying, which also wastes time each turn if it's not taken out immediately.
* [[Burrower|Burrowers]] on the second island. While they aren't necessary difficult for Blitzkrieg to deal with, their movement animation is the slowest in the game and they take several turns to take down. As such, they end up wasting a lot of time.
* [[Spider|Spiders]] and the [[Spider Leader]]; these are not as slow as the above ones, and Blitzkrieg has a particularly good matchup against them. But they can still waste a lot of time with their egg throwing animations. The former are notorious for webbing multiple Mechs and messing up deployment as well.

That said, the aforementioned Spider Leader, as well as the [[Large Goo]], allow longer chains with the [[Electric Whip]] and keep emerging enemies at bay.

Keep an eye out for freezing weapons. They are very useful at neutralizing and nullifying strong enemies instantly, leaders in particular, and preventing them from performing any actions. They are similarly useful for freezing and protecting allied NPC units that perform actions on their own (such as the [[Supply Train]]), so freezing them in place will also save time.

=== Choosing Missions ===
The fastest mission to take across most islands is '''Defend the Train''', as it lasts 4 turns instead of 5. It's fine if the train is damaged for this achievement; this will prevent the train from moving in future turns which also saves time. In general, prioritize protecting Civilian Buildings over anything else. The achievement can still be gained even with failed objectives, which also helps bypass the bonus reward screen at the end of an island and saves time.

Below are the fastest to slowest islands, with their island specific fast and slow missions noted.
==== [[R.S.T. Corporation]] ====
Particularly fast missions include any mission with the '''Cataclysm''' and '''Sandstorm''' (Advanced Edition) environmental effect. These only last 4 turns, and blocking spawns is highly encouraged to completely negate enemy actions through their entirety, as the environmental effects cancel them out.

Slow missions that should be avoided include those with the '''Seismic Activity''' and '''Lightning Strike''' environmental effects. These queue individually on different tiles in the map, and they take several seconds to go through per turn.
==== [[Archive, Inc.]] ====
The fastest mission by far is any that has '''Tidal Waves''' as an environmental effect. Just like train missions, it takes 4 turns instead of 5, and has a similarly favorable effect to Cataclysm's. If Advanced Edition is turned on, then '''Defend the Armored Train''' is similarly quick.

Slow missions that should be avoided include '''Use 3 Repair Platforms''' (Advanced Edition) and any mission with the '''Air Support''' environmental effect. The former's repair platforms have a unique repair animation, enemies included which can trigger it and waste time additively. The latter has a long animation for the plane flight, which wastes a several seconds per turn.

==== [[Detritus Disposal]] ====
The A.C.I.D. status effect present throughout this island can be beneficial for Lightning Whip's damage scaling, and is a fine backup option if R.S.T. or Archive end up having an unfavorable enemy you'd like to avoid.

However, avoid missions with environmental effects in this island; all of '''Teleporters''', '''A.C.I.D. Lakes''' with spawning enemies, and particularly '''Conveyor Belts''' can all waste time with their animations each turn.
==== [[Pinnacle Robotics]] ====
This is the only island without a possible Train mission, and all of these missions are guaranteed to last 5 turns as a result. Furthermore, some objectives like '''Defend the Robot Factories''' and the '''Ice Storm''' environmental effect waste further time. It is recommended to avoid this island completely for this achievement.

=== Further notes ===
* Spend as little time as possible in the Corporate Store after the first island. Restore the Grid Power to an acceptable level and proceed to the next Island as quickly as possible.
* You can bypass the victory screen by pausing the game when the last turn finishes resolving (as soon as the UI disappears), and then selecting ''Main Menu''. From here, select ''Continue'' and you will be brought to the mission summary screen, which skips the victory message and overall saves time after every mission.
* You can also take a screenshot of the battlefield and pause to evaluate your next moves. ''Note that this completely removes the challenge of the achievement.''

'''Lily Reed''' is a [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach''. 
==Location==
Lily Reed can be found in a pod or as a reward for completing an island`s objectives without any failure.

==Background==
Lily was an orphan found at sea at the age of seven (she's now 20), then found and raised by Archive when her makeshift life raft came in sight of their island. Lily was only newly-employed at Archive before she answered the open call for pilot training - some employees may have frowned at her sudden shift in career were it not for the urgency to find soldiers to fight the [[Vek]]. Unlike others at Archive who wished to slowly tinker with the Mechs, she embraced her training whole-heartedly, soon learning to use the Mech with one of the fastest training times of any Archive pilot on record. Lily's gone through only a few timelines (or maybe just one) and even seeing the end of the world hasn't dulled her enthusiasm for stopping the Vek. She is a talented pilot and engineer, and her near-hyperactive energy has found a good outlet on the battlefield.

==Personality==
Really excited. Hopeful and a little silly. Feels invulnerable. Sees it as a game.

==Strategy==
Can be utilized to great effect with Flying, position-intensive Mechs for a very early battle advantage. Obviously the benefits of this passive diminish greatly the longer a battle drags on. This bonus can also be a good way of quickly positioning otherwise slow Mechs, such as Artillery.

With the [[Advanced Edition]], some of the new level up abilities can synergize well with Lily. Particularly noteworthy ones include:
* Opener: on top of being [[Status Effects|boosted]], the +2 move stacks with her initial +3 move for a +5 move buff on the first turn.
* Adrenaline: the stackable +1 movement per Vek killed lets her use her initial advantage to kill a low HP Vek and stay mobile in future turns.
* Masochist: using the additional movement to purposely take damage on the first turn allows her to stay mobile with a +2 movement buff for following turns.

'''Mafan''' is a secret [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach''. 
==Location==
[[Mafan]], along with the other secret pilots [[Kazaaakpleth|Kazaakpleth]] and [[Ariadne]], is only obtainable in a run through the following process:

# Find a [[Marked mountain tile|marked mountain or ice tile]], which can be identified after entering a mission through a small glowing dot and being damaged by 1 point prematurely.
# Break the tile and collect the beacon by moving onto it with a mech or allied unit.
# After ending the turn, a '''Strange Pod''' will drop. Protecting it rewards one of the secret pilots and a reactor core.

Once unlocked, Mafan can be used as a starting pilot without doing the above method again.

==Background==
The Zoltan are an alien race from the game ''FTL: Faster than Light'' by Subset Games, the same developers behind ''Into the Breach''. Due to their alien nature, generic text is used to streamline him and other secret pilots for use in-game. 

The Zoltan are a wise, intelligent species of energy, about to transcend to a higher "level" – of consciousness. They favor enlightenment above all else. They are respectful, tactful, and humble… but not pushovers if attacked. Younger members ("children") in the lore are said to be gaining telepathic powers. 

Mafan was on a pilgrimage when the beacon summoned it. It finds the idea of the breaches to be akin to enlightenment along the lines of Groundhog Day although it finds them surprising… it considers the two week "recycling" of the self an opportunity to reflect on one's actions forever within an enclosed temporal loop. It considers the Vek to be an obstruction to this enlightenment, but also a necessary part of the phenomenon that keeps sparking the breaches to be made. (More specifics about the tone and intent of each of the lines below can be found in the Writing Style Guide, broken down line by line, if curious – it gives more information on how Mafan and the Zoltan might perceive certain events.)

==Personality==
Mafan speaks only in ellipses and other forms of punctuation.

==Strategy==

* Mafan's ability including an extra point of reactor power speeds up the early game upgrade order, enough to get certain vital upgrades earlier such as '''buildings immune'''. This makes him a very useful generic starting pilot for most squads and is rarely outclassed.
* The Zoltan shield regenerates at the start of every turn, taking one hit of any damage amount per turn (excluding lethal instakill damage). This also lets him freely block spawns without taking any actual damage, provided that he has not been hit beforehand.
* Because of the health reduction, setting him on fire after the Zoltan Shield has been downed is a death sentence, and should be avoided at all costs.
* Mafan is the best pilot to use for the [[Ice Mech]]; not only does the shield prevent self-freezing, but also lets the mech gain +1 move from the extra reactor core (the only upgrade available as +2 health cannot be upgraded).

== Trivia ==

* The Zoltan ability closely matches the abilities of the Zoltan in FTL.:
** The shield is a reference to how Zoltan ships have a bonus shield that absorbs a flat amount of damage before disappearing, although it cannot regenerate unlike in Into the Breach.
** The extra power core is a reference to how a Zoltan provides one point of power to the system in the room they are in on a ship.
** The reduction of health is a reference to how Zoltans have the lowest health out of all races in FTL.
* The +2 Mech Health, Skilled, Technician and Masochist skills are unobtainable by Mafan.

| caption = Marked Mountain Tile
|image2=marked ice tile.png}}

The '''Marked Mountain Tile''' is a special variant of either a [[Mountain Tile]] or an [[Ice Tile]] which rarely appears during [[Missions]].

== Description ==

This special tile variant spawns already damaged at the start of a mission and has a faint, yellow glow originating from inside it. The tile will appear undamaged during the mission preview and will not actually crack until the mission is begun.

Destroying the tile will reveal a '''"strange object"''' hidden inside it; upon being picked up it will broadcast a signal. After the end of that turn, a '''Strange Pod''' will fall from the sky, similarly to a [[Time Pod]]. Rescuing the Pod will unlock one of three special [[Pilots]] and grant the [[Distant Friends]] achievement.

== Notes ==
* Keep in mind that the "strange object" must be picked up by a [[Mechs|Mech]], simply protecting it until the end of the battle won't summon the Pod.
* There is a 15% chance that this tile will spawn in place of a regular Time Pod on the second, third, or fourth islands. It will not spawn on the first island, and only one may spawn in a given timeline.
* Because it replaces a regular Time Pod, it will never spawn during a boss mission. Similarly, if you've already seen an island's allocated number of Time Pods (1 for the second island, 2 for the third and fourth islands), then there's no chance of encountering it in later missions on that island.
* To maximize your chances of encountering the Marked Tile, take missions with mountains or ice tiles until you've seen the allocated number of Time Pods for an island. If a Time Pod spawns on a mission without these, you essentially forfeit one of your run's 15% rolls.
* While not collecting the "strange object" does not count as a failed objective for a perfect island, the Time Pod it replaced will not reappear later.
* It is possible to collect the beacon on the last turn of the battle, in doing so the pod will spawn at the start of the last enemy turn and will be picked up unless destroyed as normal.

== Trivia ==
* The special pilots are a reference to [[Subset Games]]'s earlier title, ''FTL: Faster than Light''.
** The sound that plays during the signal broadcast is the same as the FTL jump drive.
** The Pod resembles a broken section of the Federation cruiser from ''Faster than Light''.

}}
'''Maximum Firepower''' is one of the [[achievements]] in [[Into the Breach]].

==Strategy==
Although the achievement text in-game only specifies 8 damage with the [[Quick-Fire Rockets]], it actually requires that the damage is done to enemies only to claim it. In other words, damage done to other player mechs does not count towards the 8 damage total to claim this achievement.

To make it easier to claim this achievement, the use of [[A.C.I.D.]] or a passive like [[Force Amp]] is recommended.

'''Mech Specialist''' is one of the [[achievements]] in [[Into the Breach]].

==Description==
Beat the game with 3 of the same [[Mechs|Mech]] in a [[Custom Squad]].

==Notes==
Note that choosing multiple Mechs which have [[Passives]] equipped by default will only have 1 of that passive on one of the Mechs; the other two Mechs will have it removed.

In other words, choosing multiple Mechs of the following will only result on one of them having the indicated passive equipped in the Custom Squad:
* [[Flame Mech]] - only one Flame Mech will have [[Flame Shielding]] equipped.
* [[Rocket Mech]] - only one Rocket Mech will have [[Storm Generator]] equipped.
* [[Gravity Mech]] - only one Gravity Mech will have [[Vek Hormones]] equipped.
* [[Nano Mech]] - only one Nano Mech will have [[Viscera Nanobots]] equipped.
* [[Smog Mech]] - only one Smog Mech will have [[Nanofilter Mending]] equipped.
* [[Napalm Mech]] - only one Napalm Mech will have [[Heat Engines]] equipped.

It is possible to get both Mech Specialist and [[Flight Specialist]] achievements in one playthrough, if three of the chosen Mechs also have flight by default.

==Example Squads==

===Fast Mech Specialist===
{| class="wikitable"
!Mech 1
!Mech 2
!Mech 3
|-
|{{ficon|mech laser.png|Laser Mech|x90px}}
|{{ficon|mech laser.png|Laser Mech|x90px}}
|{{ficon|mech laser.png|Laser Mech|x90px}}
|-
|}
In easier [[Difficulty|difficulties]] (Easy or Normal), three Laser Mechs are very fast at getting the Mech Specialist achievement, as they have one of the fastest attack animations in the game. Combined with 3 damage that they deal to the first tile, they are capable of completely downing any early-game enemy without needing any displacement, which makes for very quick enemy turns as a result. For starting pilots, [[Harold Schmidt]] is a good choice to let one of the Mechs push its targets. Another good choice is [[Kai Miller]], to let one of the Laser Mechs deal 4 damage right away.

That said, this squad is only recommended in easier difficulties, as the lack of displacement becomes more problematic the higher the difficulty. This is due to the earlier presence of Alpha enemies, some of which it can't take down in one hit for the early-game, and the larger amount of enemies potentially constraining [[Burst Beam|Burst Beam's]] firing angles.

===Flight Specialist and Mech Specialist===
{| class="wikitable"

!Mech 3

[[File:All-mechs.png|thumb|right|All of the mechs]]

==Description==
Each mech is characterized by the following stats:
*'''Move''': How many tiles this Mech can move each turn.
*'''Health''': How much damage this Mech can take before being disabled. A disabled Mech cannot act for the rest of the battle, unless it is repaired by another ally or external source.
*'''Class''': The Mech's Class determines which weapons it can use without a power penalty.
*'''Special''': determines an attribute that the Mech has by default;
**'''Flying''': Flying units can move over any terrain tile.
**'''Armored''': Weapon damage to this unit is reduced by 1. All other damage (Push, Blocking, Fire, etc.) is unaffected.

Of all the mechs, there are a few that are debatably the best standard stat-wise
*The thruster mech and the drill mech both have 3 health, 4 move, and flying, making them the best flying mechs
*The judo mech has 3 health, 4 move, and armored; better than the hook mech with 3 move. This is the best armored mech
*The pitcher mech has 4 health and 4 move, giving it the highest health value of any mech

'''Medical Supplies''' is a [[Passives|passive]] equipment in the game [[Into The Breach]]. It is obtainable as an Island Reward, through the Corporate Reputation Store, or through a [[Time Pod]].

==Description==
All Pilots survive death.

==Strategy==
Medical Supplies is best used in conjunction with weapons such as [[Self-Destruct]], which would otherwise be fatal to the pilot. Medical Supplies may also be used to allow the player to play more recklessly, without having to worry about pilots dying if their Mechs are disabled.

However, since Medical Supplies takes an equipment slot, it should only be used if the player lacks other more useful equipment; otherwise, there are better ways to mitigate pilot loss, such as with the [[Repair Field]] or [[Viscera Nanobots]] passives, which also bring back disabled Mechs online in addition to preventing pilot loss. Disabled Mechs are also unable to take any actions, so the loss of a Mech should still be prevented until ideally the final turn; otherwise, even with the loss of the pilot prevented, losing a Mech during a battle carries a heavy loss in the action economy for subsequent turns.

'''Medium Goo''' is one of the  [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
A massive sized gelatinous ooze resembling a similar [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatinous_cube fictional monster]. This boss Vek can only appear in corporate islands with the "Defeat 5 Goos" objective alongside the HQ mission objective, and is excluded from the [[Volcanic Hive]].

When the [[Large Goo]] is defeated, it will split into 2 Medium Goos; when a Medium Goo is defeated, it will split into 2 [[Small Goo|Small Goos]]. The resulting enemies that come from the split will be launched and land on randomly determined tiles that the game determines as safe (i.e. avoiding tiles like fire and water, though still possibly landing in range of another enemy's attack). The split happens immediately after the Large or Medium Goo is defeated. The tiles they land on is determined at that moment based on the player Mechs placements, and can change after a [[Reset Turn]] is used and the Goo is defeated again if the Mechs are placed on different tiles.

==Strategy==
See [[Large_Goo#Strategy|Large Goo]].

==Strategy==
Mercury Fist is somewhat similar to [[Titanite Blade]], they are both limited use high damage prime weapons.

Mercury Fist, with the '''+1 Damage''' upgrade, guarantees destruction of any vek that is not a Leader; and with a Boosted pilot or A.C.I.D. applied to the enemy, it can guarantee removing virtually any Vek. Functionally it behaves exactly like a melee range [[Heavy Rocket]]. It is a good pick for any Prime Mech whose main purpose is utility/displacement, such as the [[Pitcher Mech]] or [[Dispersal Mech]].

'''Meteor Mech''' is a Ranged-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Flame Behemoths]] squad.
==Strategy==
Since the Meteor Mech's Vulcan Artillery does not deal direct damage, it's possible right from the start of the timeline to target buildings, and push melee Vek away from them without damaging them; only lighting the building on fire does not do damage to it. Note that this becomes impossible if the '''+2 Damage''' upgrade is powered with 3 Reactor Cores; thus, it is an upgrade that must be carefully considered depending on the mission and other Mechs in the squad, weighing the usefulness of additional direct damage versus the utility of protecting buildings.

In general, the upgrades for Vulcan Artillery are not as pressing to get, especially in the Flame Behemoths where the other two Mechs want upgrades sooner. The '''Backburn''' upgrade, while cheap at one reactor core, is also situational; for example, it can grant flexibility to deal with [[Leaper|Leapers]] that jump at the back line and web the Meteor Mech by setting them on fire, or by moving it forward to remove Smoke from a webbed ally while shooting another target on the opposite side (especially useful against the [[Mosquito Leader]]). Backburn can also be a useful upgrade to set up boosts, if paired with the [[Napalm Mech]] in a [[Custom Squad]].

If both Backburn and +2 Damage are powered, note that the tile behind the Meteor Mech will also deal 2 damage, before burn damage is taken into account. While this is beneficial for taking out an enemy and pushing other targets away with the ranged projectile, be careful when shooting adjacent to buildings and allies, as the direct damage from the Backburn tile will damage them.

The '''Micro-Artillery''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into the Breach]].

==Description==
Artillery with potential to launch multiple small projectiles (with push).

Deals 1 damage to the target and pushes.
===Class===
Ranged.

==Strategy==
Micro-Artillery requires a single core to power '''+2 tiles''', so that it can shoot 3 tiles in a wide line similar to the attack of the [[Artillery-Bot]], with push on all three targets. The additional tiles pushed can be useful for pushing multiple melee Vek away from buildings and objectives, notably the 2-tile wide [[Supply Train]].

Without additional range though, Micro-Artillery is a very underwhelming weapon lacking in resolution potential. Thus, if planning to use it, spare it a core for additional targeting range.

'''Mine-Bot''' is one of the  [[Sentient Weapons]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==

A cylindrical shaped robot with six mechanical legs supporting it, crouching low to the ground.

==Strategy==

Mine-bots only exist as NPC units in missions where they must be defended to claim reputation (1 [[File:Icon stars.png]] per surviving Mine-Bot). They act on their own, dropping a freezing mine in the tile they currently occupy and moving to a new tile without a mine. [[Vek]] will target them in attempts to destroy them. The mines can be used to the players advantage; either by displacing enemy Vek into the mines to freeze them, or displacing the Mine-bots on their own mines to freeze them. Frozen Mine-bots are still alive and will still count towards successful objective completion.

==Trivia==

* Mine-bots will not move on [[Time Pod|Time Pods]], however they are capable of collecting them if they are pushed or pulled on top them.

'''Mirror Mech''' is a Brute-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Frozen Titans]] squad.
==Strategy==
[[Category:Mechs]]
[[Category:Brute mechs]]

In the Frozen Titans, the intended synergy of this Mech's '''Janus Cannon''' is to shatter the [[Ice Mech]]'s self-imposed freeze while attacking another enemy with the opposite shot. Though once a pilot with a shield is acquired (such as [[Mafan]] or [[Bethany Jones]]) and are piloting the Ice Mech, this strategy usually falls to the wayside.

Since the Janus Cannon is forced to shoot in the opposite direction as the one chosen, it is preferrable to deploy the Mirror Mech in a tile with an open column or row, that have no buildings or objectives. This is particularly important if there are any webbing enemies, as otherwise getting the Mirror Mech webbed could force a situation where firing at them would also damage the grid. The pilots [[Gana]] and [[Lily Reed]] can be particularly useful in the Mirror Mech for this reason, as their ability allows the mech to either be deployed in enemy territory instantly or get into position in turn 1 respectively.</text>

==Strategy==

Missile Barrage can be fired from anywhere for high flexibility, but the number of uses and core cost limit its usefulness. Powering '''+1 Damage''' and pairing it with a pilot that has Boosted status is greatly recommended so it can hit for 2 to 3 damage; it is notably useful at taking out Psions, [[Spider|Spiders]] and the [[Large Goo|Goo]] Vek leader. It's particularly useful when used in conjunction with [[A.C.I.D.]].

'''Missions''' are issued within each [[islands|island]] you defend with your [[squads]]. Each mission has specific objectives, such as protecting or destroying certain units and buildings.

==Details==
Missions are determined by the number of bonus objectives that can be fulfilled for either [[Corporate Reputation]] [[File:icon_stars.png|link=Reputation]], [[Grid Power]] [[File:power.png|link=Power Grid]] or [[Reactor Core|Reactor Cores]] [[File:icon_cores.png |link=Reactor Core]]. A mission has at least one bonus objective and a maximum of three excluding newly-generated ones from a time pod. The number of objectives determines a sector's difficulty:
* 1 objective: Defensive shields are placed on random buildings. These missions only have one objective, that gives out one power or reputation.
* 2 objectives: No modifier applied. These missions either have two objectives, with each giving out one power, reputation or Reactor Core, or one objective that gives out two power or reputation.
* 3 objectives: High-threat detected, meaning at least one alpha Vek and increased spawns. These missions can have up to three objectives, with the total rewards adding up to 3 of either Reactor Cores, power, or reputation. Usually a building that rewards a Reactor Core will be present.
[[Time Pod|Time Pods]] can randomly appear in missions and require the player to protect it until the end of the mission or collect it using a mech or allied unit. They always reward a Reactor Core and have a chance of giving a [[Weapons|weapon]], [[Passives|passive]] or [[Pilots|pilot]]. Upon landing a new objective called '''Protect the Time Pod''' will appear, which "rewards" the pod.

A corporate island has five missions, four of which involve clearing sectors and the final one involves fighting the hive leader at the corporate HQ. Completing an island with all bonus objectives fulfilled (including time pods) and no sectors lost from losing all mechs will reward the player the choice between a new item, pilot or 2 points of grid power.

==Strategy==
* 1 Reputation can be turned in for 1 Power Grid, so gaining Reputation is equal or better than gaining Power Grid.  
** However, Reputation can only be cashed in after completing an entire island, so direct Power Grid improvements can provide short term benefits which help in the long term.
* Missions that offer [[Reactor Core]] rewards are difficult but often worth going after. (3 Reputation can be traded in for 1 Reactor Core.)
* The difficulty of successfully completing objectives varies by the pilots and mechs being used in the squad, particularly in the 1st island where only the starting pilot and the 2 corporate pilots are available along with the default weapon load-outs for each mech.
** For example, squads that lack damage output will struggle with "Kill Enemy" objectives more than squads that emphasize firepower.
** In the contrasting example, squads that lack utility options will struggle with "Do not kill the Volatile Vek" objectives more than squads that have options to neutralize it without damaging it.
** Try to avoid objectives that the chosen squad struggles with in the 1st island, at least until secondary weapons or other pilots that help cover their weaknesses are found.
* Choose the first island with the chosen squad's strengths in mind; some objectives only appear in specific islands, so it is recommended to avoid an island with lots of possible objectives that might be difficult for the squad being used.
** Refer to the [[Missions#List_of_Bonus_Objectives|List of Bonus Objectives]] below to see possible bonus objective availability per island.

=== Generic Objectives ===
For in-depth detail on island-specific missions, see each island individually. Advanced Edition missions are only encounterable if advanced missions are on.

'''Kill at least 7 enemies''': '''1 Reputation'''

* The player must kill at least the desired number of enemies to obtain reputation.
* 5 enemies on easy mode.

'''Do not kill the Volatile Vek: 1 Reputation'''

* A [[Volatile Vek]] is present at the start of the mission, which explodes as if it was under the [[Blast Psion]] when killed. It must be pushed out of the way to prevent damage.

'''End battle with less than 4 Mech Damage: 1 Reputation'''

* A counter will keep track of how much damage your mechs currently have. The counter can decrease with repairs and make the objective re-obtainable.

'''Take less than 3 Grid Damage: 1 Reputation'''

* [[Grid Charger]] will reverse the objective's counter.

'''Block Vek Spawning 3 times: 1 Reputation'''

* Block count will increase regardless of what blocks the vek. Destroyed vek spawn points through environmental conditions such as seismic activity do not count.

'''Protect the Coal Plant/Emergency Batteries/Power Generator: 1 Grid Power'''

* A 1-grid power facility replaces one of the civilian buildings in the map.

'''Protect the Old Earth Bar/Clinic: 1 Reputation'''

* A 1-grid civilian facility replaces one of the civilian buildings in the map.

'''Protect the Defense Lab/Robotics Lab: 1 Reactor Core'''

* Only mission that directly rewards reactor cores.
* A 1-grid technology facility replaces one of the civilian buildings in the map.
* Rarely occurs outside of three-objective missions.

'''Destroy the Hive Leader &amp; Protect the Corporate Tower: 2 Reputation, 1 Reputation each'''

* The mission name will include the name of the boss. If two of the same boss are in the mission due to Unfair difficulty, the one that goes first will count towards the objective.
* The corporate tower replaces one of the civilian buildings in the map. It has 1 grid.
* If goos are present, the first mission instead becomes '''Destroy 5 goos''' and will track any size of goo killed.

'''Kill 5 or fewer enemies (''Advanced Edition''): 1 Reputation'''

* Kill a maximum of the stated number of enemies to gain reputation. Best done with low-damage squads like the [[Frozen Titans]].
* 4 enemies on easy, 5 on normal and hard and 6 on unfair.

'''Knock Mites off Mechs (''Advanced Edition''): 1 Reputation'''

* All mechs spawn with Vek Mites [[File:VekMiteInfection.png|25px]], a status condition that is removed with damage, fire, A.C.I.D., freezing, or repairing. Remove all three to gain reputation.

'''Destroy 2 Vek Egg Sacks (''Advanced Edition''): 1 Reputation'''

* Vek Egg Sacks are stationary enemies with 1 health. Destroy both to earn reputation.
* Cannot spawn with conveyor belts to prevent forced damage.

== Notes== 

*For the "Kill 4 enemies inflicted with A.C.I.D." mission - drowning them in a pool of A.C.I.D. does not count, if they were not inflicted with A.C.I.D. before.
*The Train mission and any mission involving tidal waves or cataclysm will only last four turns instead of five.

I'm changing that strategy part to note that you can use it to move a webbed unit though, that is possible.</comment>

}}{{Quote|Airborne particles provide the material necessary for nano-bots to repair these Mechs.}}
The '''Mist Eaters''' are one of the [[Squads]] from [[Into The Breach]] added in the Advanced Edition. They consist of the [[Thruster Mech]], [[Smog Mech]] and [[Control Mech]] and are unlockable for 4 coins.

Much like the [[Rusting Hulks]], the Mist Eaters have a large number of smoke-dispensing tools that work to their advantage. Rather than making the smoke a Vek hazard it is instead used as a healing source with the passive [[Passives|Nanofilter Mending]] weapon, consuming the smoke tile in the process so that the mechs can still attack.

==Squad Achievements==
;[[Stay With Me!]]: Heal 12 damage over the course of a single Island.
;[[Let's Walk]]: Move Enemies with Control Shot 120 spaces in one game.
;[[On the Backburner]]: Do 4 damage with the Reverse Thrusters.

==Strategies==
* The Thruster and Smog Mechs can easily nullify enemy attacks, especially if the Smog Mech's Smoldering Shells has more smoke.
*The Thruster Mech is the most important damage source for the Mist Eaters but is very weak against groups or in enclosed spaces. Make sure it has lots of row and column space so the Reverse Thrusters can inflict the most damage.
*Nanofilter Mending is capable of reviving disabled mechs, giving the squad very high survivability. Using mechs to block attacks from damaging the grid of objectives often and rely on heals to keep your pilots alive.
*The Control Mech is one of the best science mechs as its Vek movement lets them tear each other apart, reliably neutralising two threats with one action. Getting the first movement upgrade on the Control Shot is vital and make sure that the second island has [[Leaper|Leapers]] so that they instantly kill any normal Vek.
**Control Shot can also move other allied units that can move regularly, including mechs, robots and tanks. This can be situationally helpful in moving webbed allies to safety.
**Control Shot cannot move enemies or allies without movement; this includes the [[Earth Mover]], [[Blob|Blobs]], [[Spiderling Egg|Spiderling Eggs]] and [[Digger|Boulders]].
* Smoke is extremely well-suited for missions that involve avoiding kills, but the squad's overall damage output can be a little low due to a lack of AoE damage and pushes. Missions that involve killing a lot of enemies can be challenging.
*While the large amount of smoke generation suggests that [[Camila Vera]] is the best pilot for this squad, all mechs will remove smoke and only lets her provide web immunity. The Mist Eaters work well with other pilots:
**[[Chen Rong]] and [[Archimedes]]: Lets the Control Mech maneuver out of danger after moving.
**[[Mafan]]: Grants the Control Mech +1 Movement on its Control Shot instantly.
**[[Kazaaakpleth]] and [[Harold Schmidt]]: Grants some form of push to the squad.
**[[Henry Kwan]] and [[Prospero]]: For more versatile positioning of the Smog Mech.

==Trivia==

* The Mist Eaters are the only squad in the game that have two flying mechs.

}}'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach Advanced Edition''.
==Location==
Can be acquired by completing islands.
==Background==
An ex-disposal unit worker, Morgan is a scientist eager to study the Vek by observing them in combat and collecting samples of their corpses. They wear a gas mask over their face for unknown reasons, though they occasionally make reference to an accident involving A.C.I.D.
==Personality==
==Strategy==
Ensure that Morgan pilots a mech that deals direct damage and is likely to kill an enemy Vek on the first turn, so that the damage [[boost]] activates for the following action. In the following turns, keep feeding kills to Morgan which continuously activates the boosted effect for the remainder of the mission. For the last turn, you can forego dealing the killing blow to, for example, give the kill and experience to another pilot. The Opener pilot ability synergizes extremely well with Morgan as it allows them to start every battle with a boost and makes it easier to set up a kill in the first turn.

Use caution when using weapons that deal self-damage; the boost effect also increases the self-damage dealt to the mech, which can quickly drain their mech's health without a reliable way of repairing it.

In comparison to [[Kai Miller]], Morgan has the disadvantage of starting at regular damage and must be fed a kill to get boosted for the next turn. Furthermore, Morgan must continue getting kills to keep receiving a boost. On the other hand, Morgan can afford to take damage and keep the boosted effect, which allows them to wield weapons that deal self-damage a bit more freely than Kai as well as block emerging Vek without losing the boost.

The '''Mosquito''' is a flying [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the Advanced Edition. They are only present if Advanced Enemies are turned on at the start of a new timeline.

==Description==
Much like the [[Hornet]], Mosquitoes are 2-health flying Vek that have a weak melee attack. Unlike the Hornet, however, Mosquitoes have one less point of movement and apply [[Smoke Tile|Smoke]] to the targeted tile at the end of their movement.

Mosquitoes cannot spawn on an island with any other flying Vek (Hornet, [[Moth]]) other than the island's Psion.

==Strategy==
As Smoke does not inhibit movement, it's often manageable just by moving away. However, Smoke in a poor location can sometimes cause problems, and can be particularly dangerous in combination with webbing enemies. Overall, Mosquitoes should not be considered an especially high threat enemy, and their lower health makes them easy to kill. They do have high flying movement though, so it's important to neutralize them before they are capable of moving too far away from your Mechs.

}}The '''Mosquito''' '''Leader''' is a boss [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the Advanced Edition. They only appear if Advanced Enemies are on at the start of a new timeline.
==Description==
The Mosquito leader moves and attempts to attack a single square, insta-killing whatever is on it while smoking and webbing it. This means that if a mech is targeted it cannot respond due to the combination of smoke and webs unless they are immune through [[Camila Vera|Camila Vera's]] ability or [[Passives|Nanofilter Mending's]] smoke removal effect.

==Strategy==
The insidious combination of webbing, smoking and an insta-kill effect means that you have to free your mech with other mechs. While this is achievable if the boss is alone, having another mech use its valuable Vek-moving ability means that it is wasted on dealing little damage and may lead to grid loss. Camila Vera is highly recommended if you plan on facing the Mosquito Leader early on, while most artillery mechs can land a hit on the boss and push the target out of the way.

Some well suited Squads that can counter the Mosquito Leader include;
* [[Mist Eaters]]; as they are all immune to smoke.
* [[Flame Behemoths]] and [[Heat Sinkers]]; to a lesser extent than the above squad, but they can use [[Fire]] on a webbed ally Mech (which they are immune to) and get rid of the Smoke to let them perform an action.

Remember that as long as the web is gone the targeted mech can simply move out of the way and attack it or another Vek. The Mosquito leader only has 5 health and is thus easier to take down than some other bosses when the attack is avoided, especially since the [[Combat Mech|Combat Mech's]] punch with +2 damage kills it if pushing against another object.

== Trivia ==

* Before Version 1.2.75 the Mosquito Leader was incorrectly not classed as a flying unit.

}}The '''Moth''' is a flying [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the Advanced Edition. They are only present if Advanced Enemies are turned on at the start of a new timeline.
==Description==
The Moth is a 3-health, 3-move flying Vek that fires an artillery attack much like the [[Scarab]], flying over any tiles to land on the target and deal 1 point of damage. This attack pushes the affected target and the Moth itself away by one tile.

Moths cannot spawn on an island with any other flying Vek (Hornet, [[Mosquito]]) other than the island's Psion. In addition, they also cannot spawn with either Scarabs or [[Crab|Crabs]].
==Strategy==
The Moth is the most dangerous regular flying Vek, as in tight spaces it is very likely to be knocked back into a building, dealing heavy damage to your grid. Pushing it into tiles where they can be recoiled into other Vek is a great way of using its attack to your advantage, especially with [[Force Amp]]. 

== Trivia ==

* Moths were previously able to spawn alongside Scarabs and Crabs. This is no longer the case as of version 1.2.76b.

The '''Mountain Tile''' is one of the [[Tiles]] in [[Into The Breach]].

==Notes==
Blocks movement and projectiles.

If this tile takes any amount of damage, it turns into a damaged mountain. When damaged mountain takes any amount of damage, it turns into mountain rubble.

Repairing mechs with the '''Viscera Nanobots''' passive happens after all damage calculations are rolled, with this value having a floor of 0 HP (i.e., can't be a negative number), so a mech that hits 0HP with a self-damage weapon that kills its target will be revived. Thus, high power secondary weapons that deal self-damage to the mech are great additions to the Hazardous Mechs; in particular [[Self-Destruct]], as it will revive the Mech while it instantly destroys any threats.

The Nano Mech's main weapon '''A.C.I.D. Projector''' acts much like the [[Cannon Mech]]'s Taurus Cannon by pushing its target, difference being that it applies [[A.C.I.D.]] on the target rather than damaging it. This is great utility to have by granting an increase in the damage output of the squad the Nano Mech is placed it.

If using the Nano Mech in a [[Custom Squad]], it is best paired with Mechs that have direct damage output, so they can take advantage of the A.C.I.D. status to kill enemies without relying on powering damage upgrades quite as much. The Viscera Nanobots passive is a lot more situational on Custom Squads though, so if it's not needed, it should be sold for Reputation eventually; particularly when it makes the difference to purchase an important side weapon or an additional Reactor Core.

'''Napalm Mech''' is a Science-class [[Mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
This mech is available as part of the [[Heat Sinkers]] squad.

==Strategy==
The Napalm Mech is, in some ways, very similar to the Prime-class [[Flame Mech]]. It comes equipped with both a weapon that lights tiles on fire and pushes the last enemy away, as well as a passive that grants an immunity to [[Fire|fire tiles]] for all Mechs.

The Heat Engines passive will let all Mechs consume Fire for a boost effect; when consumed, the fire will disappear from that tile. On the one hand, this means that Fire needs to be reapplied if looking to use it for limiting enemy movement; on the other hand, the Boost effect is very handy to have for the increase in weapon damage. Interestingly, the Boost effect can be gained from lava tiles in the [[Volcanic Hive]] as well; though the lava won't be removed in this case, grounded Mechs will still be immune to fire and gain a boost from submerging themselves in lava.

The Napalm Mech can use its Firestorm Generator weapon to set up these boosts; the last tile set on fire will also be pushed away, which can be useful for repositioning an ally or enemy. Compared to [[Flame Thrower]], note that Firestorm Generator will not damage enemies that are already on fire, but it does start with a higher threat range of 2 tiles and has higher potential range; it can similarly be used to shoot through buildings and push enemies on the other side, as fire does not damage buildings. Firestorm Generator can also be used to set spawn points on fire, which will force emerging Vek to suffer burn damage on the turn they emerge before attacking.

Upgrading the range of Firestorm Generator will allow greater flexibility for the other Mechs in the Squad to set up boosts; the first upgrade for '''+1 Range''' only costs 1 Reactor Core. Once the Napalm Mech gets a 2nd Reactor Core, the first upgrade can be disabled, and its Reactor ore can reallocated with the new one to power '''+2 Range'''.

If looking to use the Napalm Mech in a [[Custom Squad]], consider pairing it with Mechs that get the most out of the damage increase; a notable example being the [[Siege Mech]], which has a high damaging and displacement range with its default Cluster Artillery weapon.

The '''Needle Shot''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into the Breach]]. It is the starting weapon of the [[Techno-Hornet]] and is only obtainable when using that Mech.

==Description==
Throw needles at the enemy, pushing the furthest hit tile.

Deals 1 damage to the target. Starts with 1-tile range.
===Class===
Cyborg.
===Upgrades===
* '''Range &amp; Damage''' (2 Reactor Cores {{template:2power}}) - Increases potential hit tiles by 1 and damage on all tiles by 1.
* '''Range &amp; Damage''' (3 Reactor Cores {{template:3power}}) - Increases potential hit tiles by 1 and damage on all tiles by 1.

==Strategy==
Needle Shot is exclusive to the Cyborg Techno-Hornet Mech, and it can only be used in a timeline if that Mech is purposely chosen; either as part of the [[Secret Squad]] or under a [[Custom Squad]]. It is quite comparable to the Prime weapons [[Burst Beam]] and [[Flame Thrower]].

In particular, Needle Shot is strong at dealing with the [[Alpha Digger]], as with full '''Range and Damage''' upgrades, it penetrates boulders and deal exactly 4 damage (3 + 1 collision with its own boulder). However, Needle Shot suffers from two major flaws; first, its starting damage is too low, and thus it is mandatory for players to invest reactor cores into it in early game. And the second, which makes things worse, is that it's very expensive
to upgrade, requiring 5 cores to reach maximum damage.

'''Networked Armor''' is a [[Passives|passive]] equipment in the game [[Into The Breach]]. It is obtainable as an Island Reward, through the Corporate Reputation Store, or through a [[Time Pod]].

==Strategy==
Networked Armor increases the HP of all Mechs in the squad by 1, for only 1 Reactor Core. This can be good value if found early on, particularly for Squads and strategies that rely on friendly fire (such as with the [[Blitzkrieg]] squad).

However, Networked Armor loses value with the '''+1 Health''' upgrade, as it costs 2 Reactor Cores for another additional health point to all Mechs; this is the same cost as spending 1 Reactor Core on each Mech (for a total of 3 Reactor Cores) to upgrade their health individually. It is much better to upgrade a Mechs health individually; for the same cost, Mech HP upgrades to all doesn't take up an equipment slot on one of the Mechs, which could be used equipping a better passive or more helpful secondary weapon.

It's possible to stack HP as well, both with Mech HP upgrades and Networked Armor. However, this is only necessary for specific contexts, such as using only self-damage weapons and with no way to mitigate the self-damage to the user. Outside of those situations, stacking HP becomes redundant after a certain point; and even for those contexts, it's only necessary to keep Networked Armor if there is no better equipment available to mitigate the self-damage (such as [[Repair Field]] or [[Viscera Nanobots]]).

'''Networked Shielding''' is a [[Passives|passive]] equipment in the game [[Into The Breach]]. If the [[Advanced Edition]] weapons are turned on for the timeline, it is obtainable as an Island Reward, through the Corporate Reputation Store, or through a [[Time Pod]].

==Description==

Costs 2 Reactor Cores to power.
===Class===
Any.

===Upgrades===
Networked Armor has no upgrades.

==Strategy==
Networked Shielding prevents any damage to the players Mechs on their turn (and their turn only), meaning that Reactor Cores can be saved elsewhere by not having to power survival upgrades such as '''Ally Immune''' or Mech HP upgrades. Since Networked Shielding is not free – costing an expensive 2 Reactor Cores to power – it should be used only if the squad is very prone to friendly fire or self-damage, in order to save the most reactor cores by powering it; examples including [[Blitzkrieg]] and [[Zenith Guard]].

Do note Networked Shielding will not prevent damage from Status Effects or Enemy attacks, nor will it prevent spawn blocking damage, as these happen during the Enemies turn. It will also not prevent a pilot's death if their Mech falls into a chasm. However, it will prevent instant-kill damage from [[Self-Destruct]], so Networked Shielding has strong synergy with that weapon. Networked Shielding also prevents the self-freeze status effect from [[Cryo-Launcher]] on the user, though it will not prevent freezing the target (even if the target is an ally).&lt;ref&gt;[https://imgur.com/a/IjQtuGc Networked Shielding interaction with Cryo-Launcher]&lt;/ref&gt;

Networked Shielding could also help the [[Hazardous Mechs]], although the [[Viscera Nanobots]] passive in that squad already keeps all the Mechs alive if they get kills, so both are redundant together. Still, it's viable for Networked Shielding to replace Viscera Nanobots in that squad, if and only if Networked Shielding is gotten for free through a Time Pod or as a Perfect Island Reward. To illustrate, Viscera Nanobots is free to equip, but only heals 1 health per kill and could prevent the Mechs from effectively blocking spawns; to mitigate that issue, Viscera Nanobots requires 2 Reactor Cores to heal for 2 health per kill, which is the same amount of Reactor Cores needed to power Networked Shielding. If Networked Shielding is gotten for free, it can replace Viscera Nanobots for the same 6 Reputation cost of 2 Reactor Cores at maximum upgrades; otherwise, it's better to keep Viscera Nanobots, as buying Networked Shielding would cost 2 Reputation ''and'' an additional 6 Reputation for 2 Reactor Cores to power it.

==Notes==
Any unit that stops here will die, including flying units. Any unit pushed on to a mine will also explode.

Enemies that have '''Explosive Decay''' [[File:Icon explode glow.png]] as an ability can never appear in missions with Old Earth Mines, even if those enemies are in the islands threat scanner. These enemies include;
* [[Blast Psion]]
* [[Tumblebug]]
* [[Alpha Tumblebug]]
* [[Tumblebug Leader]] (if Archive is done as the 4th island on Unfair difficulty)

'''Overpowered''' is one of the [[achievements]] in [[Into the Breach]].

==Notes==
This achievement is best done in conjunction with the [[Backup Batteries]] achievement, which has a similar condition of earning or buying 10 Grid Power on a single Corporate Island.

It's possible to get this achievement by completing objectives that reward Grid Power, accepting '''+2 Grid Power''' as a bonus reward (or +4 in Unfair difficulty), or spending reputation on Grid Power in the [[Corporate Reputation|Corporate Store]].

In the Corporate Store, it's also possible to undo the spent reputation on power after earning the achievement; the achievement is awarded as soon as 2 Grid Power over the limit is earned, so the player will still keep it even after selecting "undo all."

'''Passives''' are pieces of Mech equipment in [[Into the Breach]].

==Description==
Passives confer a constant benefit to all [[Mechs]] in the [[Squads|squad]], without the need of activating them during an encounter. Since an action does not need to be used to activate passives, their effects will persist even when the Mech equipped with a passive is submerged into [[Water Tile|Water]], a [[Volcanic Hive|Lava Tile]], an [[A.C.I.D. Tile]], affected by [[Status_Effects|Smoke]], or even if the Mech is downed and disabled.

Some Mechs come equipped with Passives by default. All Passives are treated as '''Any Class''' equipment, and can be equipped without penalty by any [[Mech Class]] (except Cyborg).

Some Passives come with an upgrade or two, at the cost of additional [[Reactor Core]] usage. Upgrades are not purchased separately, they are included. '''Note that powering Upgrade 1 is never a prerequisite for powering Upgrade 2.'''

===Mechs with Passives in Custom Squads===
{{main|Mech Specialist}}
When creating a Custom Squad, it is possible to choose a Mech which has a passive equipped multiple times. In this case, the duplicate Mechs will have the passive removed in their loadout, and only one Mech will keep the Passive for the Custom Squad.

The '''Phase Cannon''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into the Breach]].

==Description==
Shoot a projectile that phases through Grid Buildings.

Deals 1 damage to target. Pushes target.

===Class===
Brute.

===Upgrades===
* '''Phase Shield''' (1 Reactor Core {{Template:1power}}) - Applies a Shield to buildings it passes through.
* '''+1 Damage''' (2 Reactor Cores {{Template:2power}}) - Increases damage by 1.

===Availability===

==Strategy==
Phase Cannon deals low damage to a single target, but the key advantage to this weapon is being capable of phasing through multiple buildings. Particularly with '''Phase Shield''' upgraded, it is capable of shielding several buildings in one single action, while still pushing the target on the other side of the buildings.

This gives Phase Cannon valuable utility for protecting multiple buildings and spreading damage. It works well on any Brute class Mech, as most tend to typically lack a consistent multiple resolution with their default weapons. It is notably best used with the [[Jet Mech]] and [[Thruster Mech]], which can use their flying movement for more flexible positioning. It can also work with other off-class Mechs, although the Reactor Core penalty should be considered, as it is very important for Phase Shield to be powered for the best return with Phase Cannon.

'''Pierce Mech''' is a Brute-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Bombermechs]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Pierce Mech starts with excellent stats, having a projectile weapon that deals 2 damage. The pushing capabilities and damage output are similar to those of the [[Combat Mech]], but with greater range. However, this comes at the expense of needing to shoot through another target or structure first.

In addition to units, the AP Cannon can also pierce grid buildings and mountains. Deployable units such as Bomblings, Arachnoids and Tanks can also be pierced, either before or after they move. The requirement to pierce is not always a drawback; since the pierced target is also pushed, look for opportunities to displace two enemies at once, or to push an ally in a better position with the first push.

If three or more enemy units are lined up and adjacent, this weapon can also deal substantial knock damage to multiple targets. To put this in perspective, with no upgrades to AP Cannon; the first enemy will be pushed into the second one for 1 bump damage to each, the second unit will take 2 damage and be pushed onto the third enemy, which will then take additional bump damage of 1 to each. That's a total of 4 damage alone on the second target, and 1 damage to the first and third unit. This is most useful against [[Alpha Digger]] enemies; the Pierce Mech can use its protective rocks for a pierce target and bump damage to take it out in one hit, even with no damage upgrades.

The potential damage of AP Cannon is overall high, reaching a maximum of 4 with upgrades before bump damage is considered. This can become expensive at 4 total Reactor Cores (2 per '''+1 Damage''' upgrade), so the full upgrades are best considered for 3 or 4 island playthroughs.

4 base move is reasonably mobile to start; but due to the heavy positional requirements, the Pierce Mech benefits from a pilot that offers additional mobility, such as [[Henry Kwan]], [[Prospero]], or one with additional movement as an ability.

Basic AI Pilots are already operating at their peak efficiency and do not gain experience in combat, making it necessary for you to find superior human Pilots, or advanced AI Pilots, to replace the basic AI. Cyborgs are both Pilot and Mech in one.

Unless otherwise specified, pilots are obtained by completing 100% of all objectives on [[Islands]] or collecting [[Pod|Time Pods]].

==Artificial Pilots and CorPilots==
* The Artificial Pilot is the default mech pilot if the pilot is killed. No skills and always active without a pilot in the mech
* CorPilots work for the Corporations in the current timeline, never have any special skills, and the best available pair of them start every new timeline

==Cyborg Pilots==
* Cyborg Pilots become available after unlocking the [[Secret Squad]] by completing all [[Achievements]].
* All Cyborg Pilots have randomly-selected names, a portrait depending on their mech, and the same special skill:
** Vek : Normal Pilots cannot be equipped. Loses 25 XP when the unit is disabled.

|}

==Experience and Skills==
Pilots gain experience points (XP) when Veks are destroyed while defending a region. One XP is gained for each Vek health point (HP), so a 2 HP Vek is worth 2 XP.  

The [[Soldier Psion]] adds 1 HP to each Vek giving an extra XP. A [[Hornet]] typically has 2 HP and is worth 2 XP, but with a Soldier Psion present it has 3 HP so the Hornet would be worth 3 XP. When a Soldier Psion is killed, every Vek is reduced by 1 HP. If a Vek that has 1 HP left is destroyed due to the death of a Soldier Psion, then the extra HP is taken away before the Vek dies and no additional XP is gained. If there's a Hornet with 1 HP left and the Soldier Psion is destroyed, the Hornet is reduced from 3 HP to 2 HP, then 1 HP is taken away from the Hornet. The dead Hornet gives 2 XP. 

If a Vek is not directly killed by a Pilot, such as when a Vek is killed by an emerging Vek or dies from environmental damage, the XP is split among all the Pilots in the squad. If there isn't enough XP to split among all the pilots, XP is distributed to just part of the squad on a rotating basis. 
* Artificial Pilots do not gain XP.

A Pilot sent to a new timeline, the Last Traveler, retains their XP and skills from the previous timeline. If an invulnerable pilot's mech is disabled in the final battle they will not be able to teleport away and will die at the end of the mission. Bonus skills gained via level up are completely random, but certain pilots are prevented from learning specific skills.

Note: prior to patch 1.0.17 there was no blacklist for pilot skills, and could result in Mafan ( max HP = 1 ) having a [https://i.imgur.com/arNfvBa.png useless bonus of +2 Mech HP].
{{Skills}}

==Corporate CEOs==

While not Pilots, the Corporate CEOs are heavily involved with guiding the [[Squads]] against the Vek.

There are some special skills that went unused in the game:

* Cauterize : Fire heals instead of damaging Mech.	
* Frozen Stance : Stopping on any liquid tile freezes it, making it safe to stand on.
* Retaliation : Deal 1 damage to adjacent enemies after surviving damage.

'''Pinnacle Pilot''' is a [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach''. 
==Location==
Pinnacle Pilots are Sentient AIs working for [[Pinnacle Robotics]] in the current timeline. They may appear in any unoccupied mechs upon starting a new game.

==Personality==
Pinnacle Pilots, while more advanced than Artificial Pilots, are still relatively generic in comparison to AI Time Travelers. They speak between brackets and in stilted sentences, and are generally very matter-of-fact and emotionless.

==Possible Names==
Pinnacle Pilots have a separate naming pool from other CorPilots, consisting of only one randomly selected given name. The possible names are listed below:
{| class="wikitable"
|+
!Given Name
|-
|Binary
|-
|Calypso
|-
|Celestine
|-
|Cinnabar
|-
|Clare

|-
|Leda
|-
|Mary
|-
|Penny
|-
|Qualia
|-
|Raine
|-
|Serhina
|-
|Zas
|-
|Zera
|}

==Strategy==
Pinnacle Pilots come without special skills, and only get randomized passive abilities. Due to this limitation, they can easily be outclassed by Time Travelers you encounter during your playthrough. Regardless, in most situations, having a CorPilot is still better than having no pilot at all. If they're not necessary anymore, Pinnacle Pilots can be traded in for a [[Corporate Reputation]] point after clearing any of the islands.

'''Pinnacle Robotics''' is the third [[islands|island]] in the game [[Into the Breach]]. Led by their CEO [[Zenith]], Pinnacle's community of humans and robots co-exist together to stop both the Vek and their hijacked machines.  

Upon creation of a new save file Pinnacle Robotics is locked until two islands (Both [[Archive, Inc.|Archive Inc]] and [[R.S.T. Corporation]]) are complete. Afterwards, it can be done in any order in all future timelines.

'''Pitcher Mech''' is a Prime-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Cataclysm]] squad.
==Strategy==
Because Hydraulic Lifter deals damage to units when they land, its most basic use is to toss targets onto cracked tiles, causing grounded enemies to fall instantly. Since the Pitcher Mech starts with 4HP, it can also be positioned to block enemy attacks and spawns itself; look for angles where it can also throw an enemy to get maximum value for its actions. The '''+2 Range''' upgrade in particular is a helpful unlock after the Drill Mechs damage is upgraded, so the Pitcher Mech can throw enemies into chasms and other environmental effects from as many angles as possible. Look for other environmental effects such as desert or forest tiles as well, if a cracked tile is not withing range. Enemies can also be tossed to intercept other enemy projectiles or block spawns.

Hydraulic Lifter faces limitations similar to [[Judo Mech]]'s [[Vice Fist|Vice Grip]]: the weapon itself cannot be used if there is no unoccupied tile for the target to land on, and so the target must be thrown from the right direction. For this reason, Pitcher Mech benefits from extra move and pilots that grants movement bonuses, such as [[Henry Kwan]] or [[Prospero]]. Being stable units, [[Burrower|Burrowers]]  are also unable to be targeted by Hydraulic Lifter; a secondary weapon or other ally mechs should be used to deal with these enemies.

==Trivia==
* The Pitcher Mech is the only Mech in the game that starts with 4 Health points.

}}The '''Plasmodia''' is a rare [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the Advanced Edition. They are only present if Advanced Enemies are turned on at the start of a new timeline.
==Description==
Much like the [[Blobber]] and [[Spider]], the Plasmodia is a slow-moving spawner Vek that fires a [[Spore]] using artillery range. The Spore destroys itself during the enemy turn to shoot a pushing projectile for 1 damage at a certain direction.

As a rare Vek, Plasmodia cannot spawn on the first island and are limited to only one spawn per mission. Plasmodia also cannot spawn with either Blobbers, Spiders, the [[Blobber Leader]], [[Spider Leader]] or [[Plasmodia Leader]].
==Strategy==
Compared to the other two notorious spawner Vek, the Plasmodia is the weakest as its minion does not restrict movement and only targets one tile. Since the Spore's attack queues last in the Attack Order it was summoned in, ''after'' other enemy Vek present, it's also possible for another enemy to move in front of the Spore and block its attack range. Spores that were unable to attack will simply wait until the following turn if allowed to live.

Since Spores only target one tile, they can't be as easily baited into attacking a Mech as with the other spawners. So if it doesn't compromise positioning for next turn, try to place Mechs near the Plasmodia itself; if a Spore targets it the following turn, the Mech can then simply move out of the way, and let the Spore damage the Plasmodia instead.

Nevertheless, it is still important to destroy the Plasmodia as quick as possible so that the spores do not linger.

== Trivia ==

* Before version 1.2.76b, the Plasmodia had no restrictions on spawning outside of the usual caps set for rare Vek, meaning that it could spawn with other spawning Vek and the Spider Leader.

{{Infobox mech|name=Plasmodia Leader|image=PlasmodiaB sprite.png|portrait=PlasmodiaB.png|health=5|move=2|skills={{PlasmodiaBoss_Tooltip}}|special={{Massive}}}}

== Description ==
The Plasmodia Leader fires an artillery attack that spawns a [[Vicious Spore]]. The Vicious Spore has a 2-damage ranged projectile attack that deals 2 damage, pushes, and kills the spore.

== Strategy ==
The Plasmodia leader is an incredibly weak boss, the only benefit over an [[Alpha Plasmodia]] being that the spores have 1 more health, and actually being weaker in the regard that the spores deal 1 less damage. Unlike the [[Blobber Leader]], the spores '''do''' kill themselves with their attack despite having 2 health. If you see a Plasmodia Leader, it should be a serious factor to take into consideration, as it makes the boss fight for the island much easier.

==Strategy==
Prime Spear requires 1 core to activate, which can limit its usefulness if acquired early. While it starts with 2 damage, Prime Spear's upgrades do not increase it, so lacks damage potential needed in late games.

Instead, Prime Spear focuses on increasing its range of potential targets hit, and providing utility through its push and A.C.I.D., once the '''A.C.I.D. Tip''' upgrade is active. In particular it is effective at holding a position thanks to its long range, and can provide utility against high HP Vek Leaders with A.C.I.D. applied; note however that this is applied after damage and push, not before.

==Strategy==

Prism Laser can be a strong weapon, but is both situational and requires good mechs to work with. The '''Ally Immune''' upgrade is much more important for this weapon than it is for the [[Burst Beam]] or the [[Refractor Laser]], as Prism Laser can go through allies to increase it's strength against enemies. Obtaining high damage with this weapon requires careful positioning and a fair bit of luck though, which on average makes it significantly less powerful than the Burst Beam while sharing the same downside of no enemy displacement and friendly fire to buildings.

'''Prospero''' is a [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach''. 
==Location==
Prospero can be acquired by completing islands or from [[Time Pod|Time Pods]].

==Background==

In its original timeline, Prospero was a recycler robot from [[Detritus Disposal|Detritus]]. Its job was to monitor region safety in Detritus disposal sites, but was severely damaged in a disposal accident (this was in the days before Vikram was CEO). The "recycled recycler" robot was sold at a discount to Archive as a groundskeeper for some of the nature preserves, and it seemed to take to the work, translating its knowledge of chemistry and recycling technology to help cultivate gardens (and when it wasn't able to do this, it would devour all books on botany, biology, and even spiritual books related to nurturing and growing of all life forms). It would have likely have remained a quiet hulking gardener were it not for the emergence of the [[Vek]]. When the Vek erupted on Archive, the robot followed its directives to protect the nature preserves… and saw the Vek as nothing more than garden pests to be eliminated to protect the plants. When Archive was able to send reinforcements to the region, they found Prospero still quietly tending its garden, now fertilized with Vek corpses. 

Much like [[Gana]], Prospero is viewed with some suspicion due to the robot uprising, but like Gana, Prospero follows orders and has proven itself on many occasions. When traversing to a new timeline, Prospero seems to actively avoid returning to Detritus. The reason for this is unknown.

==Personality==
Prospero has been repurposed to operate its Mech in harsh conditions. Its English is fine but isn't in love with the new "work" conditions.

==Strategy==
Prospero's 1 point flight passive can be used to great effect in "pull"-based Mechs such as the [[Hook Mech]] of the [[Blitzkrieg]] squad, or Mechs retrofitted with the swap [[Teleporter]] that otherwise cannot safely hover over dangerous terrain. As the passive is not free, it's best paired with Mechs who get the most out of versatile positioning.

The '''Psion Abomination''' is one of the Boss [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
The Psion Abomination does not attack but instead grants all other Vek "overpowered", combining the effects of the [[Soldier Psion]], [[Blood Psion]] and [[Blast Psion]].

No other Psions can spawn if the mission contains a Psion Abomination. It will never replace the 4th island's Psion enemy during Unfair difficulty (unless it is the leader of the island for the HQ mission), nor replace the [[Psion Tyrant]] during the [[Volcanic Hive]].

==Strategy==
The Psion Abomination makes every enemy harder to take down, and additionally adds the threat of '''Explosive Decay''' to the grid when other enemies are downed. In particular, squads that rely on wearing Vek down can struggle taking out the Psion Abomination. If the squad lacks firepower, it's worth putting off the island until stronger weapons are gotten.

Fortunately, the Psion Abomination does have relatively low health at 5 compared to most Vek Leaders, so an upgraded high damaging weapon can take it out in one hit.

The '''Psion Tyrant''' is a [[Vek]] psion from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
The Psion Tyrant does not buff Vek and instead damages all player-controlled units every turn, including the [[Renfield Bomb]] and deployable tanks. It has a primarily orange body with dark purple bumps adorning its head. Psion Tyrants only spawn on the [[Volcanic Hive]] and are capped at one spawn per "phase" of the final mission.

Under the [[Psionic Receiver]], the Psion Tyrant also inflicts 1 damage to all Vek, the Tyrant itself included.

==Strategy==
While the Tyrant Psion can be very dangerous to mechs with low health (usually artillery or science mechs), or mechs with self-damaging weapons, it's of no direct threat to the grid, or to mechs that have armor or a healthy amount of spare healthbar. If there are any spare cores leftover at the end of the game, placing them in +2 HP upgrades may help in order to assist with ignoring the Tyrant until a more convenient turn, so as to take care of more direct threats.

The Tyrant Psion itself is relatively weak and should be killable via collateral damage or fire. Overall it's likely better to see this Psion emerge from a spawnpoint than any other normal enemy.

Remember to take into account that a live Tyrant Psion, on phase 2 of the final battle, will attack the Renfield bomb along with your units, so factor that into the amount of damage the bomb is "allowed to take". If you have any deployable tanks, it will attack those too, so upgrading them to 3HP may also help.

The '''Psionic Receiver''' is a [[Passives|passive]] equipment in the game [[Into the Breach]]. It can be received through a reputation reward or a [[Time Pod]] in any timeline.

==Description==
Mechs use bonuses from Vek Psion.

Below is a breakdown of the bonuses provided to the players Mechs with Psionic Receiver equipped. Note that the bonuses are only active while the Psion is still alive; if the Psion dies, it also will disable the bonuses to the players Mechs.

==Strategy==
For the majority of Vek Psion in the game, Psionic Receiver is not worth an equipment slot; either the benefit gained from it is too situational – or non-existent, in the case of the Arachnid Psion – or the benefit is outweighed by the threat of the Psion's buff to other enemy Vek.

Arguably the only beneficial Psion to equip Psionic Receiver against is the Raging Psion, which will let all Mechs gain a Boost while it is alive.

To a lesser extent, the Psionic Reciever could work well in the [[Volcanic Hive]] with the Psion Tyrant present, as it will damage itself with its own Psionic Tentacles and naturally die in 2 turns; it will also help take out [[Blob|Blobs]] or [[Alpha Blob|Alpha Blobs]] from the Blobber enemies. However, the damage to the Renfield bomb must be taken into account as well; and for the final battle, it's generally much better to have another more useful weapon or passive equipment that does not depend on a specific enemy being present.

==Strategy==
All four of the tank-as-weapon variants are limited to 3 movement, and are generally much weaker than a Mech. However, they can offer a crucial 4th action per turn, along with another unit to bait enemy Vek into attacking instead of Grid Buildings.

On harder difficulty levels, the major challenge is finding a turn has enough slack to deploy the tank rather than using the Mech's (typically more powerful) primary weapon. Once the Tank is out, subsequent turns become much easier.

One advantage of the Pull-Tank variant over the other three is that it can be upgraded to have the '''Flying''' attribute. This makes it much easier to position the Pull-Tank, especially on the final level where environmental damage is frequently more effective than direct damage attacks. However, note that it still can't be deployed in [[Water Tile|water]], chasms, or similar tiles, even if the Flying upgrade has been powered; it can only move and position itself over these tiles after deployment.

'''Pulse Mech''' is a Science-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Rusting Hulks]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Pulse Mech's main purpose in the Rusting Hulks is to support its teammates with displacement and protection with shields.

The '''Shield Self''' upgrade is a good early unlock, as the Pulse Mech starts with good durability and movement to not require upgrades on those immediately. With Shield Self, this allows the Pulse Mech to activate a [[shield]] whenever it uses Repulse, even if there's no targets adjacent to push. The shield can be used to block enemy spawn points without taking damage throughout an entire battle, or to let it survive an otherwise fatal attack from an Alpha enemy.

Shields are also useful in conjunction with a freezing weapon (such as [[Ice Generator]]) to avoid being frozen; this can become more advantageous for the entire squad when the '''Shield Friendly''' upgrade is unlocked. The Shield Friendly upgrade will also protect adjacent buildings with a shield, so this upgrade can also allow the Pulse Mech to neutralize enemy attacks that would otherwise be out of its range to push.

To get the most out of the multi-push, pilots that offer mobility and positioning benefits are recommended for the Pulse Mech.

==Strategy==
Push Beam will pierce and push all units in its path, until it hits a structure or the end of the map. It can be a helpful secondary weapon for Mechs that lack displacement, as it gives them the option of pushing multiple units and redirect their attacks in the process.

Push Beam is most helpful against enemies such as [[Digger|Diggers]] and [[Tumblebug|Tumblebugs]], since it can pierce through their protective rock obstacles and push all of them away from their intended target. It's also possible to get a lot of bump damage with it, specially if multiple enemies are adjacent with the last one next to a [[Mountain Tile]]; the first units will be pushed into each other, while the last one will be pushed into the mountain.

'''Quick-Fire Mech''' is a Brute-class [[Mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
This mech is available as part of the [[Heat Sinkers]] squad.

==Strategy==
The Quick-Fire Mech is comparable to the [[Mirror Mech]] in that it's forced to shoot two projectiles, with the key advantage of being able to choose which direction the second projectile is fired. Unlike the Mirror Mech however, Quick-Fire Rockets does not have starting push and must be powered as an upgrade. The early-game can be challenging as a result of its low damage output and lack of displacement.

'''Add Push''' is a vital first upgrade, as it gives the Mech a way to reposition enemies and get bump damage. In the Heat Sinkers, consider a pilot that boosts the Quick-Fire Mech ([[Kai Miller]], [[Morgan Lejeune]]) so that it is not as reliant on consuming fire tiles from its partners. Upgrading Quick-Fire's '''+1 Damage''' to each target is expensive at 3 cores, but it should be considered eventually if doing a three or four island run. The Quick-Fire Mech is also rather frail at the start of the timeline, so boosting its health eventually is recommended; [[Mafan]] is another viable pilot choice to start, as he comes with an extra Reactor Core thanks to his ability to immediately allow for push, while boosting the survivability thanks to Zoltan Shield.

==Island-Specific Missions==
''Advanced Edition missions are only encounterable if "Advanced Missions" are on for a timeline.''

===Reputation Objectives===
* '''Defend the Earth Mover: 1 Reputation'''
**An Earth Mover situated around the middle of the map periodically creates more ground in a line. The map will have many chasms when starting.
*'''Defend the Terraformer + Terraform the grassland back to desert: 1 Reputation each, 2 in total'''
**A Terraformer is situated around the centre of the map and can convert 6 tiles in front of it into desert, kililng anything standing in the way. There are 20 tiles of grassland surrounding it which requires 4 turns to fully remove.
*'''Destroy 2 Mountains: 1 Reputation'''
**Some mountains start off cracked at the start of the mission.
*'''Protect the two prototype Renfield Bombs: 2 Reputation, 1 for each bomb'''
**Two prototype Renfield Bombs appear on the map and will explode to deal 1 damage to surrounding tiles when they are destroyed.

* '''Defend the Train: 2 Reputation'''
** A two-tile long maglev moves from one end of the map to another. If the train collides with anything or is damaged, it becomes a '''damaged train''' and one reputation point is lost. Damage it again and the train is destroyed entirely, yielding no reputation.
** Lasts 4 turns instead of 5.
** Also present on [[Archive, Inc.]] and [[Detritus Disposal]].

===Power Grid Objectives===
* '''Defend both Solar Farms: 2 Grid Power'''
**Two Solar Farms must be protected, earning 1 power for each one that survives.
=== Special Conditions ===
* '''Cataclysm'''
**A row of chasms will sprout from one edge of the map and slowly consume the land.
**Missions last 4 turns under this condition.
* '''Seismic Activity'''
**Each turn a set of 3 ground tiles will become chasms during the enemy turn.
*'''Erosion Points'''
**The map has several chasms where [[Hornet|Hornets]] and their alphas emerge. This can result in a mission having two non-psion species of flying Vek, which is usually disallowed.
*'''Lightning Strikes'''
**4 tiles in the battlefield are randomly targeted by lightning strikes each turn.
**Lightning strikes will instantly kill [[File:Icon kill glow.png]] any unit that gets hit by them.

*'''Windstorm (''Advanced Edition)'''''
**Two rows will be pushed by one tile in a single direction each turn.
*'''Sandstorm (''Advanced Edition)'''''
**A row of smoke will kick up every turn from the edge of the map.
**Missions last 4 turns under this condition.
*'''Evacuated Buildings (''Advanced Edition)'''''
**Two grid buildings away from each other are replaced with trap buildings that have 2 health. They can be detonated at will to destroy all units next to them without depleting the grid or hitting other grid buildings.

'''RST Pilot''' is a [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach''.

==Location==
RST Pilots are employees from the [[R.S.T. Corporation]] that are native to the current timeline. They may appear in any unoccupied mechs upon starting a new game.

==Personality==
RST Pilots are no-nonsense and share much of Kern's aggressive pragmatism. They tend to be harsher than the other CorPilots and have a ruthless streak. Sometimes they act stiff and military-like, but at other times, their eagerness for killing Vek comes out.

==Possible Names==
RST Pilots' names are made up of a given name (male or female) as well as a surname, both of which are randomly selected from the list below:{{template:PilotNames}}

==Strategy==
RST Pilots come without special skills, and only get randomized passive abilities. Due to this limitation, they can easily be outclassed by Time Travelers you encounter during your playthrough. Regardless, in most situations, having a CorPilot is still better than having no pilot at all. If they're not necessary anymore, RST Pilots can be traded in for a [[Corporate Reputation]] point after clearing any of the islands.

}}The '''Raging Psion''' is one of the [[Vek]] psions from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the Advanced Edition. They are only present if Advanced Enemies are turned on at the start of a new timeline.
==Description==
Raging Psions are identifiable by their squid-like black body and beige bumps. While alive, they grant all other Vek the boosted effect, increasing their damage by 1.

Psions can only spawn once per mission. The [[Psionic Receiver]] boosts all mechs when a Raging Psion is present.
==Strategy==
Since Boost increases damage by 1, this means even regular non-alpha enemies are capable of downing tiles with 2 buildings at once, making the Raging Psion particularly dangerous to the power grid in the early-game.

However, if using Mechs that can easily redirect Vek attacks into other enemies, it is preferable to let the Raging Psion live as long as possible in order to turn enemies against each other for higher damage. The Psionic Receiver passive is also particularly effective against the Raging Psion, letting the players Mechs take advantage of its passive Boost every turn that it is present.

'''Ralph Karlsson''' is a [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach''. 
==Location==
Ralph Karlsson is the first pilot and available by default.

==Background==
Ralph has crossed the breach almost more times than he can count - there's been at least a hundred timelines he's watched fall (in the opening state, he has yet to save even one). This continuous cycle of warfare has made him ruthlessly efficient, being unwilling to even sleep if he has to, as he feels every second counts... and every second that slips away could be the critical moment lost to the Vek. He's come a long way from the wide-eyed soldier he first was (it seems like several lifetimes ago, and it was), and he tries to avoid attachments to the other pilots, as he knows how likely they are to die in battle. He has never said which island he hails from, and there are suspicions he may have come from somewhere beyond the Corporate archipelago... possibly even from a space station. If true, Ralph has refused to confirm it, although in a few timelines, Bethany, Harold, and Isaac have commented on the Time Pod's architecture as being modeled off of space-faring tech (notably a launch capsule of a rocket... or an escape pod of a rocket).

==Personality==
Classic cold knowledgeable veteran type. No time for those who can't keep up. Cynical/realistic about your chances. Not a very exaggerated character.

==Strategy==
As the game's starting pilot, his boost to XP is useful in leveling up quickly; it is possible to level him up once after only two missions in the first island, and max his level as early as the end of the first island. However, since a 'last traveler's' level is saved, this ability becomes useless on consecutive runs. Furthermore the abilities gained from pilot level ups are chosen randomly, so as far as finding him as a pilot or starting a new run with him as a fresh pilot, there's a degree of luck involved to getting good abilities via level up. Thus, Ralph Karlsson is best used early on in finding other pilots and earning achievements to buy more squads.

The '''Ramming Engines''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into the Breach]]. It is the starting weapon of [[Charge Mech]].

==Description==
Fly in a line and slam into the target, pushing it and hurting yourself.

Deals 2 damage to the target and 1 self damage to the user. The self damage is also considered as an attack to the terrain. If it does not hit a target, it will not cause self-damage.

===Class===
Brute.

===Upgrades===
* '''+1 Damage Each''' (1 Reactor Core {{Template:1power}})
* '''+1 Damage''' (3 Reactor Cores {{Template:3power}})

===Availability===

==Strategy==
Ramming Engines pairs best with equipment or pilots that can mitigate its self-damage, so that the Mech using the weapon does not destroy itself in the process of using it. Examples include the pilot [[Abe Isamu]], equipping it on the [[Hook Mech]], the [[Viscera Nanobots]] passive, or a pilot/upgrade for additional HP.

As long as the drawback is mitigated, Ramming Engines is fairly strong with no upgrades, capable of doing 2 damage with push and allowing the user to dash in a straight line to its target. The '''+1 Damage Each''' upgrade is cheap at 1 Reactor Core, and provides good value for the damage increase; but once again, the increased self-damage must be mitigated first to make this weapon sustainable for long-term use.

The Ramming Speed is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into The Breach]]. It is the starting weapon of [[Techno-Beetle]], and can only be obtained by this Mech.

==Description==
Dash across the map, damaging and pushing the target tile.

Deals 1 damage to the target.
===Class===
Cyborg.
===Upgrades===
* '''Smoke Behind''' (1 Reactor Core {{template:1power}}) - Tile behind you gains Smoke.
* '''+2 Damage''' (3 Reactor Cores {{template:3power}}) - Increases damage by 2.

==Strategy==

Ramming Speed is exclusive to the Cyborg [[Techno-Beetle]] Mech, and it can only be used in a timeline if that Mech is purposely chosen; either as part of the [[Secret Squad]] or under a [[Custom Squad]]. It is like the Brute weapon [[Ramming Engines]], with the upside of having no self-damage, but with the downside of having worse initial damage.

Unfortunately, Ramming Speed's damage does not scale well with upgrades, only hitting a maximum of 3 + 1 bump damage, which is only enough to kill the frailer Alphas. The '''Smoke Behind''' upgrade can be decent, though, as it can help the Techno-Beetle cancel out another target's attack. But generally, it is best to equip a different weapon to give the Cyborg Mech more options.

The '''Random Squad''' is a special [[Squads|Squad]] in [[Into the Breach]]

==Description==
The Random Squad option becomes available after unlocking a second Squad.

A Random Squad is created out of all the unlocked [[Mechs]]. 

The '''Balanced Roll''' option selects three unique Mechs from three different classes (Prime, Brute, Ranged, Science, and Cyborg). The balanced squad won't have more than 4 weapons so this prevents the Flame Mech, Rocket Mech, Defense Mech, Gravity Mech, and Nano Mech from appearing together in a balanced squad. 

The '''Chaos Roll''' option has no restrictions on class, weaponry, or Mech combinations so you get a truly randoms quad. However, if you get duplicate Mechs with the same Passive ability, one of the duplicate Mechs will have the Passive deactivated.

==Mechs==
Player selected, no restrictions

==Squad Achievements==
;[[Change the Odds]]: Raise Grid Defense to 30% or more with a Random squad
;[[Loot Boxes!]]: Open 5 Time Pods in a single game with a Random squad
;[[Lucky Start]]: Beat the game (any length) without spending any Reputation with a Random squad

==Strategies==
* For the most powerful start, roll until you get a squad similar to one of the stronger premade squads.
** For example, [[Combat Mech]], [[Cannon Mech]], [[Boulder Mech]] is just one mech away from being the [[Rift Walkers]], but the general utility of Boulder Mech can make it even stronger.

* Some mechs have strong synergies, such as [[Smog Mech]] and [[Rocket Mech]], as both have passive equipment ([[Nanofilter Mending]] and [[Storm Generator]] respectively) that add extra utility to smoke.

* You might find a squad you would really like if one of the mechs was swapped out. Before rolling again, you may consider changing your time traveler to a pilot who can improve the weaker mech.
** For example, [[Abe Isamu]] can reduce self-damaging weapons like the [[Ramming Engines]] on the [[Charge Mech]].

* The random rolls can only select mechs from unlocked squads, so it may be a good idea to unlock a few specific mechs you think would be powerful together and use those to unlock the achievements for the Random Squad early.

* The '''Change the Odds''' achievement can be gotten by buying grid power with reputation after completing an island; the player can even undo reputation spent after hitting 30% grid defense, and the achievement will still remain unlocked.

| image    = Icon Reactor Core.png
}}
The '''Reactor Core''' is one of the [[Resources]] in  ''[[Into The Breach]].''

Reactor Cores are used for upgrading [[Mechs]]. Each installed core will give 1 additional energy that can be assigned to improved stats, power weapons, weapon upgrades, passives (extra moves, extra hitpoints) or some [[Pilots]] with special abilities.

A Reactor Core is acquired by:
* Recovering a [[Time Pod]] during a mission
* Protecting a key building during a mission
* Spending 3 [[Corporate Reputation]] Points after protecting a Corporate H.Q.

==Using Reactor Cores==
Open the Mech Upgrade screen by clicking on any Mech Icon on the left, and click on "Install" to install a core.

[[File:Mech-upgrade-screen.png|thumb]]

You can install up to 9 cores in the reactor of each Mech. [[Pilots]] can acquire the Mech Reactor skill to gain a bonus Reactor Core.

You can Undo the installation to redistribute Reactor Cores as needed.

The '''Refractor Laser''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into the Breach]]. It is an [[Advanced Edition]] weapon, and is only obtainable through a reputation reward or a [[Time Pod]] if Advanced Weapons are turned on for the current timeline.
==Description==

Pierces through units. Damages the first tile hit for 3 damage, the next tile for 2 damage, and subsequent tiles for 1 damage.
===Class===
Prime.
===Upgrades===
* '''Ally Immune''' (1 Reactor Core {{template:1power}}) - Friendly units will not take damage from this attack.
* '''+2 Damage''' (3 Reactor Cores {{template:3power}}) - +2 maximum damage.

==Strategy==
Refractor Laser is arguably the best prime-class weapon in Into The Breach, essentially being a stronger version of the [[Burst Beam]] with better range control.

The one-core initial cost is more than worth it for it's bending ability, for which its usefulness is in being able to avoid buildings and other allies, allowing the Mech to fire in almost any position. The bending can also be used offensively to hit more enemies, but to a more limited extent. Even without considering the bending ability, the '''+2 Damage''' upgrade is stronger than that  of Burst Beam's for the same core cost. At 5 single-target maximum damage, this reliably kills any non-leader enemy; and if the pilot wielding it also has a Boost active, it can one-shot the 6HP Vek Leaders too.

If you see Refractor Laser, even with no Prime-class Mech in the squad, it is almost always a good idea to get.

The '''Renfield Bomb''' is a special weapon developed by the [[R.S.T. Corporation]] to destroy the Vek. In the final assault against the Vek in the last Island, a Renfield bomb is deployed to destroy the Vek. Additionally, there are missions to defend prototype Renfield Bombs on the island of the [[R.S.T. Corporation]]. The prototype bombs are destroyed when they enter water.

Reinfield Bombs Can be moved through as if they were allies.

== Trivia ==
* There is little that the game explicitly describes about the Renfield bomb. The bomb is clearly extremely powerful, as the resulting explosion can even be seen from outer space.

The '''Repair Drop''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into The Breach]], it is not a starting weapon of any [[Mechs|Mech]] but obtainable through reputation reward or [[Time Pod]].

==Description==
Heal all player units. This includes disabled Mechs.

Single-use.

===Class===
Any.

===Upgrades===
Repair Drop has no upgrades.

==Strategy==
Repair Drop revives disabled Mechs and removes ailment states ([[Fire]], [[A.C.I.D.]] and [[Frozen]]); however, note that it will not remove a burning tile if a mech is standing on it. The weapon acts as a insurance against misfortunes, which means it's not used most of the time. Repair Drop also synergizes with [[Self-Destruct]] or other self damage weapons if [[Viscera Nanobots]] is not available, but it is not as efficient as it requires using the Mech's action.

The [[Repair Field]] passive is also a better choice, as repairing with any Mech on the squad with that passive will provide the same value, and it does not have limited uses either, making it more flexible. However, one unique trait that sets Repair Drop apart is that it also heals other allied non-Mech units; something which Repair Field can't do, as that only repairs allied Mechs.

'''Repair Field''' is a [[Passives|passive]] equipment in the game [[Into The Breach]]. It is obtainable as an Island Reward, through the Corporate Reputation Store, or through a [[Time Pod]].

==Description==
Repairing one Mech will affect all Mechs.

Disabled Mechs will also be repaired, which will bring the Mech back online and save the pilot.
===Class===
Any.

===Upgrades===
Repair Field has no upgrades.

==Strategy==
Repair Field is a highly action-efficient and cost-effective Passive for squads which are prone to friendly fire or rely on destructive weapons, the most notable examples being [[Blitzkrieg]], or any squad using the [[Self-Destruct]] weapon. It allows any Mech in the squad to essentially repair every Mech with one action. Even without such weapons, Repair Field can still provide value by allowing for more aggressive strategies, like blocking a spawn at 1HP, or tanking an [[Alpha Firefly]] projectile and reviving the Mech on the following turn. All Mechs will have any negative status effects removed as well, such as [[Fire]] or [[A.C.I.D.]]; and only one Mech in the squad has to repair with the passive equipped to accomplish this. Unlike the similar weapon [[Repair Drop]], Repair Field can be used with any Mech on the squad, and also does not have limited uses per battle, making it more flexible.

With the utility that Repair Field brings, it can decrease the reliance on HP and survival upgrades for the squad as a whole, allowing the player to distribute and focus Reactor Cores on their weapons. Pilots who can provide the [[Boosted]] status effect are also effective with the Repair Field passive; when they repair their Mech, all Mechs in the squad will repair 2 HP due to the Boosted status increasing the effect of repairs.

[[Isaac Jones]]'s Temporal Reset ability allows for a second reset per battle.

[[Adam]]'s Chosen One ability will grant a shield to his Mech after resetting, along with a +2 move bonus for that turn.

;[[Island Secure]]: Complete the first Corporate Island

==Strategies==
* The Rift Walkers is a basic, straightforward squad who works well as an introduction, but have a surprisingly weak mid-game and their default weapon upgrades require a lot of Reactors.
* The squad lacks mobility, so spending Power on +1 Move or Dash or equipping mobility-oriented pilots for the Combat and Cannon Mech helps.
* The squad's weaponry are basic, so they can swap out weapons and pilots more freely than other squads that are more synergy-dependent.
* Islands with 2-HP or lower enemies are very manageable with the Rift Walkers, as their default weapons deal sufficient damage to kill two of them at a time with both direct damage and bump damage combined.
* Conversely, the [[Shell Psion]] and [[Bot Leader]] are particularly difficult to deal with this squad until their weapons are upgraded or swapped out for other options later.

The '''Rock Accelerator''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into The Breach]]. It is the starting weapon of the [[Boulder Mech]].

==Description==
Launch a rock at a tile, pushing tiles to the left and right..

If the rock hits a target, it will be destroyed and deal 2 damage. If the rock does not hit a target, it will stay in the tile as a 1 HP obstacle to all units.
===Class===
Ranged.

* '''+1 Damage''' (2 Reactor Cores {{template:2power}}) - Increases damage by 1.

==Strategy==
Rock Accelerator offers less pushing utility compared to other standard Ranged weapons, such as [[Artemis Artillery]]; the rock only pushes the tiles perpendicular to its target, instead of all surrounding ones. Though it is higher in damage, this does limit the positions that the Mech using this weapon can shoot it from, so it is best used with mobility upgrades.

The rock itself has other unique utility as well. It can be shot at an empty tile to block enemy projectiles, such as those of [[Firefly]] enemies. It can also be shot at Vek spawn points to block them, which can be helpful for controlling Vek population without depending on repairing the Mechs HP. Enemies will also not attack rocks directly, so the rock can also be helpful at blocking the movement of enemies. Just keep in mind that the rock is an obstacle to Mechs as well, so ensure that it does not restrict your own units movement either.

The '''Rock Launcher''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into The Breach]]. It is the starting weapon of the [[Rock Mech]], which is only available through debug in the games files. In standard gameplay, it is only obtainable through through an Island Reward or the Corporate Store.

==Description==
Throw a rock at a chosen target. Rock remains as an obstacle.

===Class===
Prime.

===Upgrades===
* '''+1 Damage''' {{template:2power}}
* '''+1 Damage''' {{template:3power}}

==Strategy==

Rock launcher boasts 2 damage to start, which is strong for a no-core projectile weapon, but the lack of push prevents it from resolving stronger threats that can tank its damage. The damage upgrades are also fairly expensive for the return, requiring 5 cores to hit for maximum damage.

Note that the placement of the boulder can be controlled precisely on which tile the rock stops at. This can be useful utility, with the possibilities of blocking Vek spawns and projectiles. The fact that Vek to not directly attack boulders can also be used to the players advantage, creating impassible walls for enemy units or simply protecting a single building such as the corporate tower or a defense lab.

==Strategy==
Rocket Fist is basically an enhanced version of [[Titan Fist]]; it requires one less reactor core investment to reach full damage. Pushing the Mech one tile back provides mixed benefits; on the one hand, it can be used to cause collision damage to the Vek behind Mech, escape hazardous terrain or webbing, and move the Mech to block spawn points. On the other hand, it can also cause friendly fire damage or push Mech into hazardous terrain.

'''Rocket Mech''' is a Ranged-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Rusting Hulks]] squad.
==Strategy==
Boasting a powerful weapon in Rocket Artillery, which fires a pushing projectile and drops damaging electric smoke behind it, makes the Rocket Mech a particularly effective front-line Ranged Mech. It is conditionally capable of neutralizing two threats at once thanks to the Smoke it leaves behind; as long as there is space, it's possible to cancel one enemy attack with the Smoke by firing in the opposite direction, while hitting another enemy.

The versatile utility of smoke canceling attacks along with a starting damage of 2 makes the Rocket Mech effective in most Squads it is placed on. Regardless of where it is placed though, consider increasing its movement as soon as possible, in order to let the Mech fire from as many positions as possible.

For the other upgrades, the choice of whether to power the damage of Rocket Artillery or Storm Generator first is preference and Squad dependent. Consider Storm Generator first if playing with the Rusting Hulks, or a [[Custom Squad]] with the [[Smog Mech]]; this will effectively raise the damage output of the entire Squad. Otherwise, prioritize the damage of the rocket to ensure that the Rocket Mech kills its target; particularly if the next island has [[Alpha Digger|Alpha Diggers]] or [[Tumblebug|Tumblebugs]], which the Rocket Mech's damage is effective at taking out without being quite as hampered by these enemies Rock obstacles.

}}'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach Advanced Edition''.
==Location==
Can be acquired by completing islands.
==Background==
==Personality==
==Strategy==
Rosie Rivets is a well suited pilot for squads that lack a consistent source of healing and are prone to taking self-damage or friendly fire, such as the [[Zenith Guard]] and [[Blitzkrieg]] squads. Her Reassuring Hand special ability will activate automatically on adjacent mechs as soon as her move is confirmed, and does not cost her an action. This allows her to move and repair an adjacent ally, then use a weapon or repair her own mech, all in the same turn.

Like all the other repair actions that affect other mechs (such as the [[Nano Mech]]'s Viscera Nanobots passive or the [[Repair Drop]] weapon), Reassuring Hand can also repair mechs that have been disabled, saving the pilot's life in the process. She is also able to repair [[weapons#Deployables|deployable tanks]] when their health has been upgraded and mission specific non-mech friendly units, such as the [[Earth Mover]] and satellite rockets.

The '''Rusting Hulks''' are one of the [[Squads]] from [[Into The Breach]]. They consist of the [[Jet Mech]], [[Rocket Mech]] and [[Pulse Mech]] and are unlockable for 2 coins.

The Rusting Hulks are designed to spew damaging, electrified smoke with the Jet and Rocket Mechs. This lets them easily disable attacks and inflict high damage, but hinders itself as they cannot attack in smoke.

==Achievements==
;[[Overpowered]]:Overpower your Power Grid twice by earning or buying Power when it is full
;[[Stormy Weather]]:Deal 12 damage with Electric Smoke in a single battle
;[[Perfect Battle]]:Take no Mech or Building Damage in a single battle (Repaired damage is still damage):

==Strategies==
* The Rocket Mech can be moved next to a Vek and fire its rocket in the opposite direction, hitting nothing and dropping a smoke cloud on the Vek to prevent its attack.
* The Pulse Mech's '''Shield Self''' upgrade is a good early unlock. The shield will active whenever Push is used even if you don't push anything. It can then be used to block damage or indefinitely block a spawn point refreshing its shield each turn. '''Shield Ally''' can be used on buildings, protecting them in advance.
*Upgrading the storm generator simultaneously increases the Jet and Rocket mech's damage by 1, which makes it a priority upgrade. +1 range on the Jet Mech also lets it produce more smoke and attack flexibly. Smoke damage also bypasses the armor from the [[Shell Psion]].
*Aerial Bomb can be used to limit the movement of the Vek, as they will avoid moving into smoke.
*The Rusting Hulks make it easy to deal with powerful enemies by simply negating their attacks, but smoke clouds last for the entire battle. Try not to spread smoke around carelessly, or you could run out of options later in the fight.
*If advanced equipment is on, [[Passives|Nanofilter Mending]] trivialises this squad as it lets them remove their own smoke to attack - the lost smoke tiles can be replaced by the Jet Mech or [[Mosquito|Mosquitoes.]]
*Since the squad's biggest weakness is its own smoke, [[Camila Vera]] is bar none the best pilot for this squad. Others to look out for include:
**[[Kazaaakpleth]] - Grants a decent attack on the Pulse Mech.
**[[Kai Miller]] - Allows the Jet Mech to immediately deal 2 damage, enough to kill off 3-health enemies on island one when accounting for electrified smoke.
**[[Ariadne]] - Makes the Jet Mech much more survivable.

The '''Sand Tile''' is one of the [[Tiles]] in [[Into The Breach]].

==Notes==
Will turn into a [[Smoke Tile]] when hit by weapon damage, and therefore doesn't turn into Smoke if something takes '''Push-damage''' or damage from [[Fire]].

If you use a Fire attack, the tile will immediately turn to Fire instead of Smoke, and will not prevent units from attacking.

Saved People is the number of saved people you've saved in this time line.

Higher difficulties have more people per building in battle.

'''Scarab''' is one of the  [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
Scarabs are shaped like soft-shelled beetles. They attack similarly to artillery style Mech weapons. Scarabs will aim in a straight line at a tile and shoot over any tiles in between them and their target.
==Strategy==
The Scarab is one of the weaker early-game Vek. Unlike the Scorpion or Firefly, the Scarab can be neutralized by almost any single starting Mech without assistance from the rest of the team. That said, they can be more dangerous to the grid in groups of 3 or more, particularly if playing Unfair difficulty; since their artillery projectiles let them target buildings more easily, it can be difficult to fully neutralize all of them — along with the other Vek threats — should they all target buildings in the same turn.

If the Scarab targets a Mech, you can simply move that Mech (ideally to assist with a more dangerous enemy) and safely ignore the Scarab. If it targets a grid building, you can push/pull the Scarab one tile in any direction (assuming there are no other adjacent grid buildings), or simply kill it, since most starting Mechs are capable of dealing 2 damage in one turn.

The '''Scarab Leader''' is one of the Boss [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the [[Advanced Edition]]. It is only encountered when Advanced Enemies are active.

==Description==
The Scarab Leader fires an artillery goo that deals 4 damage and pushes adjacent tiles

In Unfair difficulty during 3 or 4 island gameplay, it's possible for the Scarab Leader to replace an Alpha Scarab at the [[Volcanic Hive]], if Advanced Enemies are turned on for that timeline.

==Strategy==
The strategy for fighting the Scarab Leader is similar for that of fighting standard [[Scarab|Scarabs]], with the complications of having a whopping 4 damage, one-shotting mechs in most scenarios, and pushing adjacent tiles. The push can actually be very useful, as you can easily position it to displace one or more Vek; but do be careful with possible bump damage against Grid Buildings as well.

'''Scorpion''' is one of the  [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
The Scorpion resembles the creature it is named after, stinger included. It is able to be encountered from the start as a regular enemy. Its goal is to restrict units' mobility with webbing, then attack them.

==Strategy==
The Scorpion is dangerous during the early game for two reasons:
* If it webs one of your mechs, you may be forced to make inefficient moves with your other mechs to free the webbed mech.
* It has 3 health, and relatively few starting mechs are capable of dealing 3 damage in one turn.
Its weakness is its low mobility, so deploying your mechs where they can still escape webbing while dealing with other threats is imperative.  Alternatively, if you keep your mechs just out of its movement range, it will waste its web attack on grid buildings, which are already stationary.  Your mechs will then be free to push it or kill it on the following turn.

'''Scorpion Leader''' is one of the Boss [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
Can web and melee attack in all four directions around itself in a cross-shape pattern. Unlike most other Scorpions, this attack also pushes its target.

==Strategy==
The Scorpion Leader has the highest health in the game, but otherwise very low movement and only a melee attack, so in general it's good to deploy so that your Prime Mech can reach it. If you have 3 damage + shove, or 4 damage, that is enough to kill the boss in 2 hits.

The boss will usually try to web/attack as many targets simultaneously as possible. In general, like with Spider eggs, be sure to avoid getting multiple of your own Mechs webbed, and try to lure the scorpion to an advantageous spot where you will be able to shove it away again into a safe place (or lure it into standing on [[A.C.I.D. Tile|A.C.I.D.]], etc.) Smoke can work well against this boss due to both cancelling its attacks and preventing it from meleeing again from that spot, but confusion/flipping won't help much at all, only breaking its webs and otherwise not preventing its attacks.

The boss's ability to shove can be very useful for friendly fire, either outright killing non-Alpha veks, or disrupting + damaging Alpha vek.

For pilots, [[Camila Vera|Camilla]] is obviously useful to negate the web, but a properly-positioned [[Silica]] can fire twice upon the boss, possibly killing it on the first turn, [[Archimedes]] or [[Chen Rong|Chen]] can reposition into a better square even if they lose movement to being webbed, and in a pinch, [[Harold Schmidt|Harold]] and [[Kazaaakpleth|a secret pilot]] can give a way to shove the boss when otherwise a mech might not be able to do it. Otherwise, this is just a high HP enemy that in principle anyone can take care of.

}}{{Quote|Humanity's last hope are a blend of Machine and Vek created to defend Earth.}}
The '''Secret Squad''' is one of the [[Squads]] from [[Into The Breach]], available to purchase for 25 coins. 

A special squad with mechs based off the [[Vek]], this squad is considered the most challenging in Into The Breach as their unique "Cyborg" class and irreplacable Vek pilots force you to adapt with little initial power.

== Description ==
The Secret Squad consists of the [[Techno-Beetle]], [[Techno-Hornet]] and [[Techno-Scarab]], whose base attacks are derived from their Vek counterparts. Unlike all other mechs these mechs have the special '''Cyborg''' class, meaning that all non-Cyborg weapons (i.e all other weapons apart from what they start with) will require 1 extra core to use. However, Cyborg weapons themselves are not tied to their mech and can be freely swapped.

In addition, cyborg mechs are commanded by a [[Cyborg Pilot]] each, which cannot be swapped out (even between cyborg mechs) and prohibit you from using your time traveller. These pilots cannot time travel to new timelines, but any additional pilots obtained can. Cyborg Pilots do not die but lose 25XP instead, which can temporarily remove a [[Skills|skill]] until it is obtained again; skills obtained are pre-determined so this cannot re-roll them. '''Popular Hero''' and '''Invulnerable''' are excluded from their skill pool if advanced pilot abilities are on.

==Achievements==
There are no Achievements for the Secret Squad.

==Strategies==

* It is unwise to play with advanced pilot abilities as the only new worthwhile ability is '''Skilled,''' while the large amount of weaker skills dilute the pool and decrease the chance of getting the valuable '''+1 Mech Reactor'''.
*Needle Shot is the best starting weapon for this squad as with only two cores it can increase its net damage from 1 to 4. Since you are guaranteed 1 time pod (and 1 reactor core), needle shot should be given to the first pilot that gets a free reactor.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/IntoTheBreach/comments/a3t84i/secret_squad_question/&lt;/ref&gt;
*The squad's core usage is very heavy, especially with other weapons. This means that getting a new weapon through a perfect island is critical to a good run; even if it is poor it can be donated for 1 reputation and raise your balance to 9, enough for 3 cores.
*Eventually, Needle Shot and Explosive Goo can deal incredible damage and neutralise many threats at once. An additional weapon should be placed on the Techno-Beetle, as its weapon does not scale as well over time and can remain unupgraded.

==Trivia==
*The Secret Squad is the only base-game squad with only one mech starting at 3HP. This trait is shared with the [[Heat Sinkers]] and [[Cataclysm]] with the release of [[Advanced Edition]].
*Before Advanced Edition the Secret Squad would only be obtainable if all achievements have been obtained, assuming all other squads have been unlocked. After Advanced Edition purchasing all squads with all coins leaves 5 coins remaining.
*Needle Shot's upgrades are based on each level of [[Hornet]]; the unupgraded attack matches that of the regular enemy, one upgrade makes it attack like its alpha and both upgrades make it attack like the Hornet Leader.

'''Self-Destruct''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into The Breach]]. It is not a starting weapon of any [[Mechs|Mech]] but obtainable through reputation reward or [[Time Pod]].

==Description==
Mech explodes, killing self and anything adjacent to Mech.

Single-use.

===Class===
Any.

===Upgrades===
Self-Destruct has no upgrades.

===Availability===

==Strategy==
Self-Destruct needs to be used with support weapons that provide external repair utility; such as the pilot [[Rosie Rivets]] in another Mech, or equipment such as [[Viscera Nanobots]], [[Repair Drop]] or [[Repair Field]]. If these are not available, the player may also dismount the pilot from the Mech using Self-Destruct to prevent loss.

The ability to one shot bosses with Self-Destruct is very unique; it can even take down a shielded [[Bot Leader]] in one action. This makes the weapon quite effective, if the loss of the Mech can be mitigated. It is preferable to mount this weapon onto a flying Mech, which helps positioning.

'''Sentient Weapons''' are creations of [[Pinnacle Robotics]] that are a second type of enemy encountered only on Pinnacle's Island.

Sentient Weapons are classified as enemies, in a separate category from [[Vek]]. They do not benefit from Vek Psion bonuses, and they are not affected by the [[Force Amp]] or the [[Void Shocker]] passives; however, their damage output is affected and increased by the [[Vek Hormones]] passive.

In some mission bonus objectives, it is possible that sentient weapons will be part of the defensive objective; whether as NPCs or hostile units. Some of them can be turned into an ally unit by fulfilling a specific objective, such as '''Destroying the Hacking Facility'''. Veks will only target Sentient Weapons if they are ally units or NPCs.

==Background==
These autonomous weapons of war were created by Pinnacle... And promptly went rogue.

The '''Shell Psion''' is one of the [[Vek]] psions from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
Shell Psions are identifiable by their squid-like silver body and purple bumps. This is important for choosing which island to save as the psion will be present on all missions in said island, making the initial Vek preview vital. 

As with most Psions except for the [[Psion Tyrant]], the Shell Psion is encounterable from island 1. It grants all non-psion Vek the Hardened Carapace buff, reducing incoming weapon damage by 1 much like [[Abe Isamu]]'s pilot ability. Psions can only spawn once per mission. 
==Strategy==
The Shell Psion can be particularly challenging to encounter for damage-focused squads, as many Mechs initially only do one point of damage. This becomes absolutely nightmarish on island 1 and can remain a problem on later islands with loads of alphas. If your squad cannot immediately kill them with one attack, spend your cores on movement and damage upgrades. Otherwise, spot which island has the Shell Psion and avoid it.

For squads that have ways to bypass armor, they can make dealing with the Shell Psion's effect much easier. These include:

* Bumping into other objects
* Electric smoke and fire damage
* Deaths from falling into water or chasms
* Repositioning enemies into blocking spawns
* A.C.I.D

}}
'''Shield''' is a status effect in ''Into the Breach''. A shield will absorb any non-fatal damage once, and prevent status effects while it is active.

==Description==
Shields can be applied on [[Mechs]], [[Vek|Veks]], structures, other allied/enemy units, and [[Mountain Tile|mountains]]. A shield can be applied on the [[Supply Train]], but it's considered one shield even though train has two units; attacking on any part of the train removes shield from whole train and conversely, applying shield on any part of the train grants shield on the whole train.

The shield persists through turns indefinitely, only disappearing once damage removes it. Any status effects such as Fire and A.C.I.D that the tile has applied will immediately affect the unit after the shield is removed.

A shield sacrifices itself and completely blocks any single attack from the following sources, regardless of the damage amount:
* Vek attack (including [[Psion Tyrant]] [[File:Icon tentacle glow.png]] damage)
* Friendly weapons
* Blocking emerging Vek spawns
* Collisions
* '''Explosive Decay''' [[File:Icon explode glow.png]] damage

Intuitively, when combo damage (e.g. damage + push collision) happens in one move, the first damage breaks the shield and the second damage will land on the unit. It's important to note that AOE damage like [[Electric Whip]] will hit units with two segments (such as the train) twice, thus will still damage a shielded train.

Shields also block the following status effects without sacrificing itself:
* [[Fire]]
* [[A.C.I.D. Pool]]
* [[Frozen|Freeze]]

Note that applying a shield on units already inflicted with those status effects doesn't remove them, and won't prevent Fire damage. Ending the turn on a tile with [[Mine-Bot|Freeze Mine]] will remove the mine without sacrificing the Shield or freezing the shielded unit. Casting a shield onto a frozen unit will make it both frozen and shielded, which is resistant to two attacks.

A shield ''can not'' block any [[File:Icon kill glow.png]] '''Instant Kill''' attacks, including:
* [[Self-Destruct]]
* Satellite Rocket launches or being rammed by the Supply Train
* Falling in a [[Chasm Tile]]
* The [[Mosquito Leader]]'s attack
* Environmental kill effects such as '''Air Bombing''' or '''Lightning Strikes'''

==Abilities and Weapons That Grant Shields==
* Missions with only 1 objective will start some buildings with shields.
* The [[Passives|Auto-Shields]] passive module, which makes a building get a shield after it has been attacked once.
* The '''Shield Projector''' Weapon and similar; e.g. [[Defense Mech]] in the [[Zenith Guard]] Mech Squad.
* Certain upgraded weapons, such as the Spartan Shield and Grappling Hook
* Shield Tank, a purchasable classless deployable weapon.
* Some [[Cannon-Bot]] enemies, the [[Bot Leader]] boss, and some stationary units from bonus objectives in [[Pinnacle Robotics]].
* [[Bethany Jones]]' skill.
* [[Mafan]]'s skill.
* [[Adam]]'s skill.</text>

The Shield-Tank is one of the [[weapons#Deployables|deployable tanks]] in the game [[Into the Breach]]. It can be found in a [[Time Pod]] or as a Reputation reward.

==Description==
Deploy a Shield-Tank that can give [[Shield|Shields]] to allies. Single-use.

The Shield-Tank starts with 1 HP and 3 move points.

===Class===
Any.

===Upgrades===
* '''+2 Health''' (1 Reactor Core {{template:1power}}) - Increases the Shield-Tank's max health to 3.
* '''Projectile''' (1 Reactor Core {{template:1power}}) - The Shield-Tank instead fires a projectile, allowing you to Shield distant targets.

==Strategy==
All four of the tank-as-weapon variants are limited to 3 movement, and are generally much weaker than a Mech. However, they can offer a crucial 4th action per turn, along with another unit to bait enemy Vek into attacking instead of Grid Buildings.

On harder difficulty levels, the major challenge is finding a turn has enough slack to deploy the tank rather than using the Mech's (typically more powerful) primary weapon. Once the Tank is out, subsequent turns become much easier.

Compared to the other deployable tanks, the Shield-Tank is the weakest one. It does not initially start with a projectile, and can only protect 1 building at once with the Shield it casts. However, it's still an extra unit, which still carries the same benefits as other deployable tanks for baiting enemies, blocking spawns with the '''+2 health''' upgrade active, and recovering time pods.

It is highly recommended to power the '''Projectile''' upgrade immediately, if using the Shield-Tank, as it will allow it to have greater flexibility for where it is deployed. The Shield itself can be useful for protecting frail objectives, such as the [[Mine-Bot|Mine-Bots]] of Pinnacle. It can also be useful to prevent status effects, such as on the [[Ice Mech]], or friendly fire damage such as with [[Blitzkrieg]].

==Strategy==
Shield Array can be quite strong at protecting multiple allies and Grid Buildings, similarly to [[Ice Generator]]. The '''Size+1''' upgrade is very important to power, so that it can be as impactful as possible with its limited uses. The shield itself is a universal solution to all kinds of non-instant kill attacks, and can be used to let any ally survive one lethal attack.

However, unlike Ice Generator, Shield Array does not prevent Vek from using their action, and will even give them a shield should they be in range. Very rarely can shielding an enemy Vek be helpful – for instance, to protect the [[Volatile Vek]] – but most of the time, it is undesirable.

The '''Sidewinder Fist''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into the Breach]]

==Description==
Punch an adjacent tile, damaging and pushing it to the left.

Starts at 2 damage.
===Class===
Prime.
===Upgrades===
* +1 Damage {{Template:2power}}
* +1 Damage {{Template:2power}}

It is not mentioned in-game, but having both +1 Damage upgrades powered also gives a dash for one square before attacking the target.
===Availability===

==Strategy==
The Sidewinder Fist boasts a powerful damage output, with the somewhat-unique ability to push in a direction other than forwards or back. The extra mobility dash that a fully-upgraded Sidewinder Fist has can also benefit positioning, specially for breaking out of webbing.

'''Siege Mech''' is a Ranged-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.

==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Steel Judoka]] squad.

==Strategy==
Unlike other ranged weapons, Cluster Artillery does not deal damage on the center of their shot; instead, the weapon deals damage on the surrounding tiles while simultaneously pushing them. This makes the Siege Mech one of the most versatile Mechs in the game, by being able to push and damage multiple enemies at once, to generate a lot of value per action; it can hit and displace several threats at once, simultaneously resolving them and damaging them. Like similar ranged weapons, it's also useful to push webbing Veks away from your other mechs or objectives. 

That said, it is recommended to get '''Buildings Immune''' as soon as possible, since the wide damage area makes it a lot more prone to friendly fire. As of the [[Advanced Edition]] update, this upgrade only costs 1 reactor core (instead of 2 previously), at the expense of increasing the cost of '''+1 Damage''' to 3 cores (instead of 2 previously).

The Siege-mech is best deployed in a clear row or column to move through, so that it can flexibly target the entire field from every direction. Best placed further in the back away from enemy spawns, as it's low health can put it at risk of getting webbed and downed. Since it only deals one damage at base, and most Vek come with two or more health, the player should try to use it and push Vek into each other, your own mechs, or water and hazard tiles to immediately kill them. 

In terms of pilot choices, [[Mafan]] allows his extra reactor core to go into Buildings Immune immediately, and the Zoltan Shield makes up for the fragility of the mech. Other good choices include [[Kai Miller]] to immediately boost Cluster Artillery's damage output, [[Lily Reed]] to let it deploy away from webbing enemies without sacrificing its positioning, and [[Chen Rong]] to adjust positioning after firing.

When it comes to secondary weapons to look for, the cluster artillery pairs best with passive effects such as [[Force Amp]] to deal additional push damage. Other weapons can work as well, but the Cluster Artillery is already very versatile at resolving many situations without additional help.

}}
'''Silica''' is a [[Pilots|pilot]] in ''Into the Breach''. 
==Location==
Silica can be acquired by completing islands.

==Background==
Silica is a hybrid of Pinnacle and R.S.T. technology, believed to be one of the first (and possibly only) artificial intelligences devoted to terrain architecture. 
In "his" original timeline, Silica was responsible for first detecting and studying the [[Vek]], and eventually was modified to investigate their hives... this nearly ended catastrophically, and Silica was recovered and his programming altered from terraforming to terraforming-based-combat... the concept of using the existing terrain and shaping it, exploiting it, and using the surrounding region as a weapon against the Vek. When Silica jumped timelines, his original programming was unknown to every subsequent timeline, and they have seen him only in his role as a environmental tactician, designed to help the islands defeat the Vek.

==Personality==
A relatively calm, pragmatic machine who has adjusted to the change in its original purpose of mineral survey to destruction. It tends to quantify its responses in terms of how actions will affect the environment first, then the individuals second.

==Strategy==
Silica's Double Shot, while expensive at 2 power points, can drastically alter the playstyle of a given Mech depending on their equipment. Easiest to recommend are the Prime-class Mechs, which will often be placed front and center and frequently contested by the Vek, eliminating the need to reposition before retaliating. Even more directly benefiting from Double Shot is the Flame Behemoths' [[Flame Mech]], which requires your target already be on fire in order to do direct damage; and Blitzkrieg's [[Lightning Mech]], which can remain close to buildings and use the chained electric damage twice in one turn. Note that Repairing counts as an action, so it is also possible to Repair before or after using a weapon if his Mech does not move, which is useful if using Silica's Mech to block spawns.

On the more silly side of strategy, one can get very creative with personal movement "attacks", such as [[Boosters]] or [[Teleporter]] as substitute for standard movement, while also impacting enemy positioning. Further still will be making Silica's Mech a dedicated healer by equipping them with the [[Repair Field]] passive, though this can be difficult to maintain given how powerful enemy attacks become late-game.

Each of the [[Pilots#Time_Travelers|Time Travelers]] has their own inherent skill unique to them, and every Pilot can develop two additional skills via experience gain; the first new skill is earned after accumulating 25 experience, and the second after accumulating an additional 50 experience. Skills earned this way are pre-determined randomly at the start of the timeline for each pilot.
==Universal Skills==
The following skills can be learnt by all pilots, with some exceptions listed below.
{{Skills}}

== Unique Pilot Skills ==
The following skills are unique to their respective [[pilots]], and cannot be earned randomly via experience gain.
===Base Pilots===
* '''Experienced:''' Gain +2 bonus XP per kill. ''([[Ralph Karlsson]])''
* '''Frenzied Repair:''' Push adjacent tiles when repairing. ''([[Harold Schmidt]])''
* '''Armored:''' Mech gains [[Armored]]. ''([[Abe Isamu]])''

'''Slide Mech''' is a Science-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Arachnophiles]] squad.
==Strategy==
When playing the [[Arachnophiles]], the Slide Mech is your only reliable displacement option; its primary goal is reducing the amount of threats to the grid. That can be done by enabling good ricochets for the [[Bulk Mech]], pushing enemies into deadly threats like [[Chasm Tile|Chasms]] or [[Water Tile|Water]] tiles, bumping them into each other to allow the [[Arachnoid Mech]] to finish them off, or simply moving targets around so they attack something else.

Area Shift works like a restricted [[Wind Torrent]]; it allows you to shift up to 7 targets (push up to 4 + bump up to 7), not including the Slide Mech itself. This can be extremely useful in missions with high Vek population by spreading bump damage. If looking to take advantage of bump damage, consider raising the Slide Mech's HP and powering the '''Shield Self''' upgrade, as its starting 2 HP makes it very frail otherwise. Similarly, the Shield upgrade helps in dealing with melee range Vek, which can otherwise still target the Slide Mech when shifted. A particularly powerful combination is Area Shift with [[Force Amp]]; the latter will increase all bump damage by 1, and can let the Slide Mech deal a lot of damage with just Area Shift.

In general, the Shield Self upgrade for Area Shift is one of the best choices during the early-game, as it only costs 1 core while letting the Slide Mech tank any Alpha Vek attack and stay online. It is also invaluable for blocking Vek spawns as you can easily renegerate the shield by simply shifting onto a [[Spawn Tile]]. The '''Shield Ally''' upgrade is a beneficial later upgrade to allow the squad more blocking and tanking potential, or if playing with the [[Ice Generator]] to keep the whole squad free of being frozen. However, unlike the [[Pulse Mech|Pulse Mechs]] Repulse upgrade, note that it does not grant shields to adjacent buildings.

Despite its high utility potential, the Slide Mech is highly constrained by its grounded movement range, so it will definitely benefit from an alternative weapon, especially one that can target any point on the battlefield. Pilots that grant movement utility are great for this mech as well, such as [[Archimedes]]; once you gain Shield Self, you can shift up to 4 tiles and tank an attack or block a spawn. [[Prospero]] is another great choice, as it enables you to shift enemy units into deadly threat tiles with much more flexibility.

'''Small Goo''' is one of the  [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
A massive sized gelatinous ooze resembling a similar [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatinous_cube fictional monster]. This boss Vek can only appear in corporate islands with the "Defeat 5 Goos" objective alongside the HQ mission objective, and is excluded from the [[Volcanic Hive]].

When the [[Large Goo]] is defeated, it will split into 2 [[Medium Goo|Medium Goos]]; when a Medium Goo is defeated, it will split into 2 Small Goos. The resulting enemies that come from the split will be launched and land on randomly determined tiles that the game determines as safe (i.e. avoiding tiles like fire and water, though still possibly landing in range of another enemy's attack). The split happens immediately after the Large or Medium Goo is defeated. The tiles they land on is determined at that moment based on the player Mechs placements, and can change after a [[Reset Turn]] is used and the Goo is defeated again if the Mechs are placed on different tiles.

==Strategy==
See [[Large_Goo#Strategy|Large Goo]].

'''Smog Mech''' is a Ranged-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Mist Eaters]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Smog Mech brings a mix of damage and utility with its Smoldering Shells weapon and Nanofilter Mending passive, providing a way to both neutralize several enemies while increasing the survivability of the Squad it is in. This combination of default equipment makes it one of the most versatile Mechs in the game.

Smoldering Shells can set one enemy on [[fire]] while cancelling attacks of surrounding Vek with smoke. It also deals respectable damage, starting with 1 point of direct damage + 1 more from fire, for 2 total starting damage. Though expensive in reactor cores, both '''More Smoke''' and '''+2 damage''' are solid upgrades, and good candidates for earlier cores; More Smoke is typically recommended first, as it lets it neutralize more threats significantly and heal more allies from more flexible positions. The +2 damage upgrade deals 3 damage directly, +1 more from fire damage, for a total of 4 damage, which is excellent for Ranged class Mechs. Spawns can also be ignited to preemptively deal damage to emerging Vek; do note however that Smoke will cancel out any fire tiles, and put out fire on enemies as well.

Nanofilter Mending negates the main downside of Smoke preventing Mechs using an action on it, allowing free movement on tiles with smoke while absorbing it for an action-free repair. This is a particularly useful passive when the More Smoke upgrade from Smoldering Shells is powered, as the Smoke can be useful for reviving downed mechs and keeping mechs with self-damaging weapons active.

The Smog Mech works very well in many [[Custom Squad]] combinations. Some notable examples include the [[Rocket Mech]], which synergizes very well with [[Storm Generator]] by letting all smoke deal passive damage; the [[Leap Mech]], which can target Smoke with [[Hydraulic Legs]] to push and damage multiple enemies and heal itself, letting it raise its damage earlier without worrying for survival; and the [[Ice Mech]], which can be repaired by targeting it with Smoke to remove the self-inflicted Freeze status from [[Cryo-Launcher]]. But in general, almost any Mech appreciates the additional survival and Smoke utility offered by the Smog Mech.

Good starting pilots for the Smog Mech include:
* [[Kai Miller]] and [[Morgan Lejeune]]; early-game common enemies are eliminated in one hit once fire damage is taken into account (2 direct damage + 1 fire damage). Once upgraded, the maximum damage with a [[Boost]] is 5 counting fire, which is an important breakpoint for being able to eliminate most alphas.
*[[Archimedes]] and [[Chen Rong]] are other great pilot options, as they can move return to a better position in the board after firing near a corner.

Smoke Bombs is like [[Aerial Bombs]] with no damage, but higher potential range for the same 2 core cost. Smoke Bombs is also an Any Class weapon, whereas Aerial Bombs is Brute Class, which means that Aerial Bombs has the advantage of being equipped on more Mechs with no penalty.

While smoke is powerful at nullifying enemy actions, having multiple smoke tiles on the map can also be a handicap without careful planning. It is a good fit on squads that rely on spreading smoke, such as with [[Storm Generator]].

Smoke Drop is a great support weapon to successfully resolve situations where Vek threats are out of Mech range. It is particularly useful with the [[Rusting Hulks]], which can let it simultaneously cancel attacks and deal Electric Smoke damage. It's important to keep in mind its limited use though, as well as ensuring that the Smoke does not handicap the squad's positioning for future turns.

==Strategy==
Smoke Pellets can be helpful at denying an area to enemies, particularly when multiple melee-range enemies target that Mech. The Smoke itself should be spread cautiously though, as it will also prevent your own Mechs from attacking in those tiles, unless paired with an immunity to Smoke; be particularly careful in tight corners and narrow passages, which could also inhibit your own Mechs from performing their action from those spots in future turns. But with good planning, Smoke Pellets can neutralize multiple enemies at once, and prevent them from attacking a certain area for the rest of the battle.

The '''Ally Immune''' upgrade is not recommended; since Smoke does not prevent movement, there's no disadvantage to placing Smoke on adjacent allies, as they can simply move out of the way or use their action before Smoke Pellets is used. This is even more true with squads like [[Mist Eaters]], who actually ''want'' to cast Smoke on each other for the action free repair.

'''Smoke Tile''' is a [[Tiles#Modified_Tiles|modified Tile]] in [[Into The Breach]].

==Description==
Units in Smoke cannot attack or repair.

A [[Sand Tile]] that is hit by weapon damage will turn into a Smoke Tile. Some [[weapons]] and enemy attacks are capable of creating their own Smoke Tiles as well.

Units under Smoke will be denoted with the '''Smoke''' [[File:Icon smoke glow.png]] status, and will clear if the unit moves out of Smoke.

If a unit is on [[Fire]] when it moves into a Smoke Tile, the fire will be put out. On the other hand, if a Smoke Tile is hit by an attack that does fire damage, the Smoke will be replaced by a [[Fire Tile]].

Except for Fire, Smoke can stack with other modified tiles, including [[A.C.I.D. Pool|A.C.I.D. Pools]].

There exist a few units who are '''Smoke immune''' [[File:Icon smoke immune glow.png]]. Some examples include;
* [[Spiderling Egg|Spiderling Eggs]] - the webbing effect will be interrupted by Smoke, but not the hatching of a [[Spiderling]]
* Some friendly units such as [[Mine-Bot|Mine-Bots]], which can still use their actions even if under Smoke.
* Any Mech being piloted by [[Camila Vera]] can still use weapons or repair, even under smoke tiles.

}}The '''Smoldering Psion''' is one of the [[Vek]] psions from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the Advanced Edition. They are only present if Advanced Enemies are turned on at the start of a new timeline.
==Description==
Smoldering Psions are identifiable by their squid-like pink body and blue bumps. While alive, they grant all other Vek fire immunity and make them leave a fire tile on death.

Psions can only spawn once per mission. The [[Psionic Receiver]] grants fire resistance to all mechs under its presence.
==Strategy==
Despite the Smoldering Psion granting all enemy Vek an immunity to fire, they will still avoid ending their movement on fire tiles if they are not already on fire. The player can use this behavior to their advantage by allowing destroyed Vek to light ground on fire and limiting their options; in particular look for chokepoints besides buildings. Due to the Vek's behavior with avoiding fire tiles, the Smoldering Psion is generally not an immediate threat nor priority to take out.

The only squad that should avoid an island with the Smoldering Psion are the [[Flame Behemoths]], as its passive silences all of their firepower with their default weapons. Conversely, the [[Heat Sinkers]] can highly benefit from killed Vek leaving fire behind to consume it for boosts, and thus is a beneficial enemy for that squad to encounter early.

'''Soldier Psion''' is one of the  [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
The jellyfish-like Psions act as support units, providing passive bonuses to the [[Vek]]. The Soldier Psion is distinguished by its pale blue coloration and bright green cranial nodes. This Psion provides a health bonus to all other Vek units on the field.

Under [[Psionic Receiver]], all of the players Mechs will gain an additional +1 HP while the Solider Psion is alive.

==Strategy==
The Soldier Psion can make even frail enemies like [[Hornet|Hornets]] more sturdy, and allows the sturdiest Alphas survive 5 damage attacks. That said, the amount of experience earned from killing all non-Minor enemies is increased by 1 while the Solider Psion is alive, so look for missions that have instant-kill effects — such as '''Destroy the Damn''' or '''Cataclysm''' — if you want to give your pilots more experience per enemy.

Killing a Soldier Psion results in the immediate reduction of the maximum and current health of all Vek on the map by 1 HP. This reduction will immediately kill any Vek that were at 1 HP before the Psion was killed. However, the reduction in maximum HP happens before the Vek dies meaning that a Vek is worth their original XP amount. For example, a 2 HP Vek like a Burrower that has 3 HP when a Soldier Psion is present, is worth 2 XP when the Soldier Vek is killed.

The Spartan Shield is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into The Breach]]. It is the starting weapon of [[Aegis Mech]].

==Description==
Bash the enemy, flipping its attack direction. 

Starts at 2 Damages, doesn't affect multi-target attacks.
===Class===
Prime.

===Upgrades===
* Gain Shield {{Template:1power}}
* +1 Damage {{Template:2power}}

==Strategy==
Spartan Shield starts as a fine weapon with decent damage, and it usually guarantees resolution of common Vek threats as it flips their attack direction. However, its damage cap is low at 3, and the return of the upgrade is out-weighed by other prime weapons' upgrades in terms of damage. It is also not effective against enemies that hit in multiple directions, such as the [[Scorpion Leader]].

Usually, '''Gain Shield''' is worth powering so that Spartan Shield can be used better as a utility weapon later in the run. The Aegis Mech, however, is a decent pick as it starts with 4 movement points.

The '''Spawn Tile''' is one of the [[Tiles#Modified_Tiles|modified Tiles]] in [[Into The Breach]].

==Description==
[[Vek]] will emerge here next turn. Any unit blocking this space will take one damage.

==Notes==
Spawn Tiles appear in the bottom of the map. The game prioritizes columns B through G, and rows 1 to 3. It will only use the corners, or tiles closer to the player, if no viable positions are present (for example, during the '''Cataclysm''' environmental effect in [[R.S.T. Corporation]]).

Spawn Tiles can appear on most non-liquid tiles, examples including a [[Forest Tile]], a [[Fire Tile]], a [[Cracked Tile]], an [[A.C.I.D. Pool]], a [[Sand Tile]] or a [[Smoke Tile]].

Spawn tiles will never appear under a [[Time Pod]] that has not yet been collected. However, a Spawn Tile can appear on the same tile the Time Pod landed in ''after'' it was collected.

A unit which blocks the spawn point will prevent the Vek from emerging.

The [[Force Amp]] passive will increase the damage taken by enemy Vek who are blocking Spawn tiles.

Blocking damage to Mechs can be nullified with the [[Stabilizers]] passive.

The '''Spider''' is a rare [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
Spiders have very limited movement, but have the unique ability of throwing a [[Spiderling Egg]] on any column or row they are aligned with. This egg traps all surrounding entities in webs upon landing and will hatch into a [[Spiderling]] on the next turn.

As a rare Vek, Spiders cannot spawn on the first island, and are limited to one spawn per mission (including [[Alpha Spider|its alpha]]).

==Strategy==
The Spider's main point of annoyance is that it can web multiple mechs at once, which becomes especially unfortunate when a move has to be wasted on freeing them rather than protecting the grid or completing the objectives. Artillery attacks are the best way of dealing with Spiders as they hang out behind other Vek and are hard to target with other mech classes. Global and wide area targeting attacks also work very well, such as [[Electric Whip]] and particularly [[Missile Barrage]]; the latter which guarantees taking care of both the Spiderling Egg and the Spider if fully upgraded.

When deploying against Spiders, ensure only one Mech at most gets webbed by their Spiderling Egg. This can be accomplished by deploying near one or two [[Civilian Building|buildings]], leaving an empty space between the Mech and the buildings. The Spider will prioritize to web as many targets as possible, stationary buildings included. If lacking global targeting weapons that can attack the Spider and its sticky egg, the Mech used to bait the Spider should also have a weapon that lets it escape webbing while still contributing to neutralizing the spider or other enemies. Weapon examples that accomplish this include [[Hydraulic Legs]], [[Teleporter]], and [[Boosters]], among others.

The '''Spider Leader''' is one of the Boss [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
The Spider Leader starts with two spiderling eggs that hatch before the player turn. Each time the spider leader moves, it will throw two spiderling eggs onto random locations around the map. Unlike normal spiders these eggs do not immobilise adjacent units.

Unlike all other leaders Spider Leaders can only appear in the boss mission of an island. On Unfair [[difficulty]], they cannot appear on regular missions in the fourth island.

==Strategy==
Weapons that can effectively spread damage or displace multiple targets are highly recommended when facing the Spider Leader. The multiple eggs spawned at the beginning of each turn can create obstacles for your grounded mechs, and its multiple spawned [[Spiderling|Spiderlings]] can become troublesome if left unchecked as they spread through the map.

== Trivia ==

* Before Version 1.2.78 the Spider Leader could appear on regular missions of the fourth island in Unfair mode.

'''Spiderling''' is one of the [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
Spiderlings, spawned from [[Spiderling Egg|Spiderling Eggs]], are a very weak 1-health, 1-damage enemy that can quickly overwhelm the player with numbers.

==Strategy==
Spiderlings, with 1 health, can easily be killed with the same things that can easily kill a Spiderling Egg: fire, pushing, and electric smoke. Standard weapon damage is typically overkill and should be spent on stronger enemies if possible.{{Vek}}

'''Spiderling Egg''' is one of the  [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Description==
The Spiderling Eggs are spawned directly by [[Spider|Spiders]], [[Alpha Spider|Alpha Spiders]], and [[Spider Leader|Spider Leaders]]; and spawned indirectly by [[Arachnid Psion|Arachnid Psions]], which cause other Vek to spawn eggs upon death. The eggs spawned by Spiders and Alpha Spiders appear larger and web adjacent targets upon being created. The egg will, on it's turn, kill itself and spawn a [[Spiderling]]

==Strategy==
Destroying Spiderling Eggs can be useful, but if the eggs are in a bad spot it may not be worth it to try. Spiderling will typically move to a new spot after hatching which may be more advantageous. Good methods for removing them involve [[fire]], pushing, and [[Storm Generator|electric smoke]], which all deal 1 damage and will kill the eggs next turn. For Arachnid Psions, killing vek over a spawn point will also work wonderfully, both destroying the egg and blocking a spawn.

The '''Spring-Loaded Legs''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into the Breach]]. It is an [[Advanced Edition]] weapon, and is only obtainable through a reputation reward or a [[Time Pod]] if Advanced Weapons are turned on for the current timeline.
==Description==
Leap and attack a tile (next to your landing point), dealing damage and pushing it.

Starts with 2 damage to the target. Costs 1 Reactor Core {{template:1power}} to power.
===Class===
Prime.
===Upgrades===
* '''+2 Range''' (1 Reactor Core {{template:1power}}) - Leap up to 4 tiles away
* '''+2 Damage''' (3 Reactor Cores {{template:3power}}) - Increases damage to the target by 2.

==Strategy==
Spring-Loaded Legs boasts powerful single-target damage, displacement and mobility, only VERY rarely being completely unable to attack. The unique range of motion allows pushing Vek into the tile the mech was standing on, escaping webbing easily, passing chokepoints, and even resolving a threat by landing on water or smoke. Recommended to upgrade first is the additional '''+2 Range''' so that the mech using Spring-Loaded Legs has more options and versatility. It essentially functions as an upgraded and more flexible [[Titan Fist]] for the majority of the game, and the initial Reactor Core cost more than makes up for the mobility bonus.

'''Squads''' in ''[[Into The Breach]]'' determine the [[Mechs]] you can take with you onto the battlefield.   

You start with the Rift Walkers squad. Additional squads are unlocked by completing [[Achievements]]. Each completed achivement earns 1 coin. 

Each squad has a custom paint job. Unlocked mech colors can be applied to other squads. 

=== Random Squads and Custom Squads ===
Once a second squad is acquired, the option to create a randomized squad or a customized squad opens up. 

A Custom Squad allows for the selection of any Mechs that have been unlocked, including multiple of the same class as well as multiple of the same Mech.

A Random Squad is created out of all the unlocked Mechs. 
* The '''Balanced Roll''' option selects three unique Mechs from three of the five different classes (Prime, Brute, Ranged, Science, and Cyborg). The balanced squad won't have more than 4 weapons so this prevents the Flame Mech, Rocket Mech, Defense Mech, Gravity Mech, and Nano Mech from appearing together in a balanced squad.
* The '''Chaos Roll''' option has no restrictions on class, weaponry, or Mech combinations so you get a truly random squad. 
** However, if you get duplicate Mechs with the same Passive ability, one of the duplicate Mechs will have the Passive and any power associated with it removed.

=== Secret Squad ===
The Secret Squad becomes available after unlocking the 8 named squads. 25 Coins are required to unlock the Secret Squad.

With the Advance Edition release is not longer needed to complete all Global and Squad based achievements in order to unlock the Secret Squad. After getting all new achivements, 5 coins are left and cannot be spend in anything.

}}The '''Starfish''' is a rare [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the [[Advanced Edition]]. They can only be encountered if advanced enemies are turned on at the start of a new timeline.
==Description==
Starfish attack by striking the four corner tiles around them, much like a grounded 4-way [[Hornet]]. Despite being based off an aquatic creature they are capable of drowning.

As a rare Vek, Starfish cannot spawn on the first island are are limited to two spawns per mission.
==Strategy==
The basic Starfish is one of the weakest Vek around as it is very brittle and pushing it often leaves it attacking nothing or other enemies. If they are attacking four grid buildings at once, push or kill it fast, then focus on other Vek.{{Vek}}

}}The '''Starfish Leader''' is a boss [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the Advanced Edition. They only appear if Advanced Enemies are on at the start of a new timeline.
==Description==
The Starfish Leader attacks for 3 damage to the four corner tiles and pushes the four adjacent tiles outward.

==Strategy==
The Starfish Leader is unique among enemies in that it is the only one which targets every single tile around it, for a total of 8 tiles. However, it only attacks the 4 diagonal tiles on the outside, while only pushing away the tiles directly beside it.

In a similar vein to the [[Scorpion Leader]], you can bait the Starfish Leader into attacking your Mechs; so deploy two Mechs near the Starfish Leader, with one space between those Mechs, since it will prioritize attacking as many targets as possible. Try to keep it away from layouts with Grid Buildings lined up, as it is otherwise more difficult to displace safely. The pushed tiles can also be used to your advantage, for either pushing your own Mechs to more advantageous spots or push other Vek into hazardous tiles; just be wary of possible bump damage against Grid Buildings.

'''Status Effects''' are a variety of negative effects that can be applied to units in [[Into The Breach]].

==Description==


==List Of Status Effects==
{| class="sortable article-table"
!Effect!!Description!!Notes
|-
|[[File:Icon fire glow.png]]'''[[Fire]]'''||Units on Fire take 1 damage at the start of every turn||''See related article''
|-
|[[File:Icon frozen glow.png]]'''[[Frozen]]'''||The affected unit is invincible but unable to move or attack. Any damage will free the unit|| ''See related article''
|-
|[[File:Icon acid glow.png]]'''[[Corroding A.C.I.D.]]'''||Weapon damage against this unit is doubled. All other damage (Push, Blocking, Fire, etc.) is unaffected
|
*Caused by tiles coated in acid, as well as various weapons.
*A.C.I.D. does apply to self-damage from weapons like [[Unstable Cannon]].
*Also doubles the increased damage taken resulting from a Boosted attacker.
|-
|[[File:Icon smoke glow.png]]'''Smoke'''||Units in Smoke cannot attack or repair||
*Can be caused by directly damaging a [[Sand Tile]] (push damage won't cause Smoke).
*Any attacking enemy unit that ends its turn on a Smoke Tile will have its attack cancelled.
*Smoke does not prevent explosions, [[Vek]] spawns and death-effects like one that [[Arachnid Psion]] grants.
|-
|[[File:Icon grapple glow.png]]'''Webbed'''||Webbed units cannot move, but they can still attack||
*Webbed units will break free if they can somehow ''move'' away from their current tile or their captor's attack is cancelled. Examples include pushing into an empty tile (even if captor also moves in the same direction), dashing etc.
*[[Teleporter]] and similar weapons do NOT remove Webbed status.
|- 
|[[File:Icon armor glow.png]]'''Armored'''||Incoming weapon damage is reduced by 1. All other damage (Push, Blocking, Fire, etc.) is unaffected||Multiple instances of Armored on the same unit (e.g. [[Abe Isamu]] piloting a [[Judo Mech]]) are redundant.
|-
|[[File:Icon shield glow.png]]'''[[Shield|Energy Shield]]''' || Shields block damage and any negative effects (Fire, Freezing, A.C.I.D, etc.). Only direct damage will remove the Shield. || ''See related article''
|-
|[[File:Icon kill glow.png]]'''Deadly Threat''' || The weapon or environment effect on this tile will kill any unit. Shields and Ice will not block. ||
|-
|[[File:Icon guard glow.png]]'''Stable''' || Cannot be moved by any weapon effect (Push, Teleport, etc.). ||Stable units can't be pushed into other units to cause Push damage, but pushing other units into them will work as expected.
|-
|[[File:Icon boosted glow.png]]'''Boosted'''||On their next action, unit's weapons will do +1 Damage or Healing.||
*Boosted, just like Corroding A.C.I.D., affects self-damage.
*Deployable and spawned units like [[Light Tank]] or [[Arachnoid]] are unaffected.
|-
|[[File:VekMiteInfection.png|25px]]'''Vek Mites'''||Unit is infected with Vek Mites. Damage, fire, A.C.I.D., freezing, or repairing will remove them||
Only appears in ''Knock Mites off the Mechs'' mission objectives. Removing all three grants 1 [[File:Icon stars.png]] reputation.

'''Stay With Me''' is one of the [[achievements]] in [[Into the Breach]].

==Notes==
If a pilot with the [[Skills#Advanced_Edition_Pilot_Abilities|Technician]] ability is piloting a Mech, it will also count towards the amount of healed damage for this achievement. Thus, it's recommended to place a pilot with Technician on the [[Thruster Mech]] to make this achievement easier to get.

The '''Steel Judoka''' is one of the [[Squads]] from [[Into The Breach]], unlockable for 3 coins. They consist of the [[Judo Mech]], [[Siege Mech]] and [[Gravity Mech]].

Rather than relying on high damage from mechs the Steel Judoka has little offensive power, relying instead on using positional weapons, pulling and pushing to make the Vek target each other. This is essential for dealing with enemies as [[Vek Hormones]] are immediately active.

==Achievements==
;[[Unbreakable]]: Have Mech Armor absorb 5 damage in a single battle
;[[Unwitting Allies]]: Have 4 enemies die from enemy fire in a single battle
;[[Mass Displacement]]: Push 3 enemies with a single attack

==Strategies==
*Since you will mostly rely on Vek damage to kill enemies, constantly check the Attack Order. In addition, look for Vek like the [[Firefly]] or [[Gastropod]], as they can easily target other Vek with their attacks and prevent two enemies from damaging the grid by being intercepted.
*Prioritize upgrading +1 damage on Vek Hormones and Buildings Immune on the Cluster Artillery - both upgrades take advantage of the squad's strength in turning enemy fire against them.
*Because the Judo Mech has armor, you can still hit it with the cluster artillery without taking damage.
* Look for an enemy two spaces away from a deadly tile -- vice fist can throw them into it.
* You can use the repositioning abilities of the squad in succession: first place two enemies adjacent to each other, then get bonus damage on knockback.
* Be wary of taking on an island if it has [[Burrower|Burrowers]] and [[Alpha Burrower|Alpha Burrowers]]; since these enemies are stable, they cannot be targetted by Vice Fist nor pulled by Grav Well, which makes them particularly difficult to deal with multiples using the Steel Judoka's default weaponry. Ensure you have some other weapon or ability with the Judo Mech at least to deal direct damage to them first.
* Many pilots can synergize with this squad:
**[[Henry Kwan]] and [[Prospero]] can more easily get into position to throw enemies by moving through obstacles. Prospero can also let the Judo Mech throw Vek on a ledge into insta-kill tiles.
**[[Harold Schmidt]] gives a free additional "weapon" to knockback enemies.
**[[Kazaaakpleth]] on the Judo Mech allows it to attack directly in front, significantly boosting its power.
**[[Chen Rong]] or [[Archimedes]] can get the Judo Mech out of a bad spot after attacking, compensating for the limited choices of tiles to attack from.
**[[Kai Miller]] on the Siege Mech can make the killing of Vek faster, especially as she will raise the maximum damage of Cluster Artillery to an impressive 3 points.

==Trivia==
* The Vek Hormones passive equipped with the Gravity Mech also increases the damage done by [[Sentient Weapons|robotic enemies]], despite not being classified as Vek nor affected by Psions.

So, [[Shield]]/[[Frozen]] applied on one part of the train will affect the whole train. Meanwhile, abilities that break Shield/Frozen will also remove the effect from whole train if they hit any part of the train. In particular, Vek attacks that damage both tiles of a shielded/frozen train, effectively damage it. The first hit removes protection, the second hit applies damage. Similarly, hitting a shielded/frozen train with [[Electric Whip]] will not only remove the Shield/Frozen effect but also hit train by weapon damage&amp;nbsp;— this is probably a bug.
* Sustaining any damage, Supply Train becomes Damaged Train, which also has 1 HP and spans 2 tiles but doesn't move. The "Defend the Train" mission objective gets partially failed and is renamed to "Defend the damaged train".
* Every turn, train moves two tiles forward. If a unit stands on it's way, it gets hit by the train with mechanics similar to a normal collision:
** Unit dies, even if shielded or frozen. Like with normal collision, the unit is not pushed from it's tile.
** The train either doesn't move or moves only one tile, depending on the distance to the unit.
** Like with normal collision, the train gets damaged unless it has [[Shield]].
* Using train to kill Vek, keep in mind: unlike deadly environmental effects, train acts ''after'' Vek attacks.
* Frozen effect stops train from moving forward.
* Train is an allied unit, mechs can move through it.
* Train has the following [[abilities]]: Fire Immunity, Smoke Immunity and Stable.</text>

'''Swap Mech''' is a Science-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Flame Behemoths]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Swap Mech is a very versatile Mech that relies on manipulating unit positions, but relies on getting upgraded Teleporter range to maximize its potential. Understanding how to best take advantage of Teleporter is vital, examples including:
*Ways of turning Vek attacks against their own by swapping with them; before choosing targets to swap with, check the Attack Order.
*Positioning the Swap Mech above environmental hazards, such as water, lava, or acid; and swapping with a grounded Vek.
*Swap with allies or empty spaces to eke out extra squares of movement, or escape webbing.

Upgrading the Range of its Teleporter can give you a large advantage in the mid and late game; the first upgrade for '''+1 Range''' only costs 1 Reactor Core, and is recommended first. Once the Swap Mech gets a 2nd Reactor core, you can disable the first upgrade, and reallocate its Reactor Core with the new one into '''+2 Range'''. Maximum range is ideal to have by the end of the game, particularly in a 3 or 4 island run.

Placing your previous Time Traveler, preferably with an extra Reactor Core ability, on the Swap Mech has a few economical benefits. The Swap Mech is unlikely to gain XP, which doesn't affect a leveled-up Time Traveler. The Swap Mech also starts with 0 Power, but with +1 Mech Reactor, the Swap Mech can be used to extend the Teleport range right away.

The '''Targeted Strike''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into The Breach]], it is not a starting weapon of any [[Mechs|Mech]] but obtainable through reputation reward or [[Time Pod]].

==Strategy==
Although low in damage, Targeted Strike has the flexibility of letting the mech target any tile on the map for one turn, pushing out of range Vek away from buildings or into hazardous terrain. As such, this is most valuable on mechs with weapons that do not move enemies, and/or have low move speed themselves (e.g. [[Lightning Mech]] with [[Electric Whip]], [[Laser Mech]] with [[Burst Beam]], [[Ice Mech]] with [[Cryo-Launcher|Cryo Launcher]])

The '''Taurus Cannon''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into The Breach]]. It is the starting weapon of the [[Cannon Mech]].

==Description==
Fires a powerful projectile that damages and pushes its target.

Deals 1 damage to the target.
===Class===
Brute.
===Upgrades===
* '''+1 Damage''' (2 Reactor Cores {{template:2power}}) - Increases damage by 1.
* '''+1 Damage''' (3 Reactor Cores {{template:3power}}) - Increases damage by 1.

==Strategy==
Taurus Cannon offers a basic line-of-sight projectile with damage and push on its target. To get the most out of it, place the Mech at a diagonal space next to a corner, so they can fire it in as many directions as possible even if they get obstructed.

While it does offer good direct range, Taurus Cannon has a lot of weaknesses. Firstly, the weapon can only fire at targets if there's no obstructions, so the Mech using the weapon still requires movement upgrades to get favorable lines of fire. Secondly,  the damage falls off, capping at 3 with push for a very expensive 5 Reactor Core cost total; the first '''+1 Damage''' upgrade costs 2 and can be helpful for destroying Psions, but the second one costs 3 Reactor Cores and only marginally helps kill the frailest Alpha enemies. Finally, it has low resolution potential, requiring some luck with enemy placement to resolve multiples for one action.

'''Techno-Beetle''' is a Cyborg-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Secret Squad]] squad.
==Strategy==
In the Secret Squad, one advantage the Techno-Beetle has is being the only mech that starts with 3HP. This allows it to be more reliable at blocking spawns than the other two cyborg mechs. Unfortunately it also has poor starting damage and, like its other Secret Squad Cyborg class mechs, suffers from a reactor core penalty to power any other secondary weapon and passive.

Powering the '''Smoke Behind''' upgrade for Ramming Speed is recommended to do so early, as it is cheap and allows the Beetle to neutralize two targets for one action (in a similar vein to the [[Rocket Mech]]). Upgrading '''+2 Damage''' gives it a total potential damage output of 4 (3 direct damage + 1 bump damage), but it is rather expensive at 3 reactor cores and is only enough to kill the weaker Alpha enemies.

Even with the Reactor Core penalty, consider looking for a better secondary weapon that gives the Beetle either more displacement utility (such as [[Wind Torrent]]) or damage (such as [[Mercury Fist]]).

'''Techno-Hornet''' is a Cyborg-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Secret Squad]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Techno-Hornet's '''Needle Shot''' weapon has comparable utility to other Prime class weapons, letting it target one tile and push its target. The main difference is that its starting damage is lower by comparison, somewhat made up by the Techno-Hornet's flight and high starting mobility.

Consider more Mech Health as a first upgrade for the Techno-Hornet, since the Mech does better close to enemies. More health will help it block spawns more consistently, and will make it more durable for body-blocking enemy projectiles if needed.

Despite its low starting damage, Needle Shot's reactor core upgrades scale impressively well and should be considered for early upgrades; while expensive, they increase damage and range by 1 point each. The additional range can be controlled much like the [[Flame Mech]]'s flame thrower weapon, and overall gives the Techno-Hornet very high potential damage output, capping at hitting 3 tiles for 3 damage each (for 9 damage total).

'''Techno-Scarab''' is a Cyborg-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Secret Squad]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Techno-Scarab functions similarly to the Ranged-class [[Artillery Mech]], with its default '''Explosive Goo''' weapon allowing it to target one tile for damage and push all adjacent units. Like its other Secret Squad counterpart mech, it suffers from being Cyborg-class, which imposes a reactor core penalty to power any other non-Cyborg equipment.

One trait that sets Explosive Goo apart from other ranged weapons is the ability to increase its target range via an upgrade, at a cheap cost of 1 reactor core. The additional range targets a tile in front of the one chosen and comes with mixed benefits. On the one hand, this allows the Techno-Scarab to spread damage among two targets and push up to 6 tiles surrounding the two chosen, which greatly assists it in controlling enemy positions. On the other hand, it is forced to shoot two tiles if the upgrade is active, which can put the Techno-Scarab in situations where it could unwantedly target a building or push an enemy to hit a building. Thus, its an upgrade that can offer excellent utility for a cheap cost, but its downsides should also be carefully considered depending on the mission and the map.

The '''Teleporter''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into The Breach]]. It is the starting weapon of the [[Swap Mech]].

==Description==
Swap places with a nearby tile.

Starts with 1-tile range. If the Mech is webbed and swaps places with another unit, the other unit will become webbed.
===Class===
Science.
===Upgrades===
* '''+1 Range''' (1 Reactor Core {{template:1power}}) - Extends range of the swap by 1 tile.
* '''+2 Range''' (2 Reactor Cores {{template:2power}}) - Extends range of the swap by 2 tiles.

==Strategy==
Teleporter is one of the best displacement weapons in the game. It moves Vek up to 4 tiles which is only matched by [[Grappling Hook]], and it has much less restrictions than the latter. The only downside of this weapon is that it requires substantial investment of reactor cores (3 fully upgraded) to make it as versatile as possible. Once fully upgraded though, it is almost always possible to solve two Vek threats at one time using Teleporter.

The Terraformer is a "stable" (cannot move) unit with 2 health points, suffers fire damage, and can destroy a 6 tile region in one direction each turn. It only appears in the [[R.S.T. Corporation]] missions to '''Terraform all Grass tiles''' and '''Defend the Terraformer'''. It will instantly destroy anything in its range, including [[Mountain Tile|mountains]].

===Strategy===
Move enemy units into its range or freeze them in place, and then fire the weapon to destroy the 6 tiles. There is no health limit on the kill zone so alpha units are easier to kill. Just beware of keeping your own units away from its range.

The '''The Big One''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into the Breach]]. It is an [[Advanced Edition]] weapon, and is only obtainable through a reputation reward or a [[Time Pod]] if Advanced Weapons are turned on for the current timeline.

==Strategy==
The Big One is a powerful weapon with very wide range, but its drawbacks are too large and prevalent to ignore. Having 2 self damage – though it can be reduced or removed through upgrades – makes this weapon unsustainable for common use. The damage, while always decent, falls off on later islands when Alpha Vek become the norm. Thus, The Big One is often too weak for taking out Alpha enemies by itself to justify an equipment slot. Also, hitting 9 tiles will inevitably lead to many situations where it can't be used for risk of friendly fire to the grid.

In general, The Big One is a high-damage weapon that may be useful for squads with multiple sources to repair damage with, but should never be relied on as a primary weapon.

The '''Thermal DIscharger''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into the Breach]], it is the starting weapon of [[Dispersal Mech]].
==Description==
Damage one or more tiles in a line and push away adjacent tiles. (Starts with 2-tile range)

The pushed tiles are to the left and right of the targeted tiles, much like [[Hermes Engines]].
===Class===
Prime.
===Upgrades===
* '''+2 Range''' (2 Reactor Cores {{template:2power}}) - Increases the maximum range by 2.
* '''Add Fire''' (3 Reactor Cores {{template:3power}}) - Adds Fire to all hit tiles.

==Strategy==
Thermal Discharger is an extremely versatile utility weapon, with the downside of requiring heavy Reactor Core investment and failing to have any real damage in later islands. At its core, it has mediocre damage with huge pushing capabilities.

To get the most out of the side pushing angles, it is recommended to power additional '''+2 Range''', and pair Thermal Discharger with a mobility oriented pilot like [[Prospero]] or [[Henry Kwan]]. Mech movement upgrades are also recommended, as the weapon is very positioning sensitive. Theoretically, an off-class flying Mech could work too, but the Reactor Core penalty is undesirable given Thermal Discharger's already heavy upgrade costs.

The '''Add Fire''' upgrade is powerful and recommended if paired with immunity to Fire; but unlike the [[Flame Thrower]], it does not push any enemies that it damages, and therefore the damaging range lacks resolution potential for high-health threats. In the [[Heat Sinkers]], the low damage is somewhat mitigated by heat engines allowing for a boost every turn when the discharger is fully upgraded. Otherwise, the weapon is mostly reliant on the lateral pushes to resolve enemies.

'''Thruster Mech''' is a Brute-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Mist Eaters]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Thruster Mech is the main damage dealer of the Mist Eaters; while it isn't the most impactful mech in its home squad, it can provide value by cancelling one attack each turn and dealing up to 2 damage right from the early-game.

Dealing high damage with the Reverse Thrusters requires the '''Range &amp; Damage''' upgrades, along with moving long distances. This can sometimes result in the Thruster Mech being farther away from enemies for the next turn. While its innate flight gives it good mobility, having 5 or even 6+ move can still be helpful. The weapon also requires an unoccupied tile to finish its movement on, so any with enemies or obstacles can restrict where it finishes its attack (and thus, its damage). That said, with the Thruster Mech's flight, it can thrust over [[Mountain Tile|mountains]], [[Civilian Building|grid buildings]], and enemy units freely; it just needs a viable tile to move to.

In the Mist Eaters, [[Nanofilter Mending]] repairs upon entering smoke, so the self-damage isn't as crippling of a drawback as with other self-damage mechs such as the [[Charge Mech]]. Try to move the Thruster Mech into smoke whenever below full health. Like with the [[Viscera Nanobots]] passive, if the mech loses its last health point while thrusting into smoke, it will then heal and revive. Note that if this happens over a [[Chasm Tile]], the mech will fall in before revival. If need be, the Thruster Mech can even be revived by applying smoke to it on a later turn.

While functional at 3 health due to the smoke healing, the Thruster Mech still appreciates an additional Health upgrade, or a way to mitigate the self damage. This is particularly important if using the Thruster Mech in a [[Custom Squad]] without a way to repair it. Good pilots for mitigating the self damage are [[Abe Isamu]], [[Mafan]], [[Ariadne]], or any pilot with the +Health, Skilled, or Technician pilot abilities. Alternatively, the Thruster Mech can also be paired with the [[Hook Mech]] in a Custom Squad, and have them swap their weapons right at the start of the timeline; since the Hook Mech has natural armor, it won't take self-damage from Reverse Thrusters, and the Thruster Mechs high movement with flight can be used for better positioning with [[Grappling Hook]].

==Trivia==
* The Thruster Mech bears a vague resemblance to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbirds_machines#Thunderbird_1 Thunderbird 1] from the sci-fi TV series, ''Thunderbirds''.

{{Infobox
| name     = Pod
| image    = Fp Pod.png
}}
==Description==
During each [[Missions|Mission]], there is a chance for a pod to appear from the future, dropping it onto a random tile. 

A new objective is added when this event happens: Protect the Time Pod.

Protecting or rescuing the Pod always grants a [[Reactor Core]]. Time Pods may also contain a [[Pilots|Pilot]], a [[weapons|Weapon]], or a piece of [[Passives|Passive]] equipment.

If the Vek end on the tile where the Pod is, or if it takes damage from a Mech or a Vek attack, the Pod will be destroyed. Projectile weapons can pass safely over the pod, but not piercing/beam weapons. A Pod is still destroyed if the Vek who steps on it has Flying. If the Pod remains untouched until the end of the mission, it is recovered as well.

==Trivia==
* The Pod will typically drop on the half of the map closest to where the Vek spawn.
* Rescuing the Pod counts towards clearing an Island perfectly - if one is destroyed, it counts as a failed objective.
* The Pod cannot be frozen.
* Although tides do not do damage directly, they will still destroy the Pod. The same is not true of Ice Storms.
* Lighting the pod's tile on fire will destroy the pod, even if no actual damage was done to the tile.
* Vek do not destroy the pod if they run over it, only if they finish their turn on the pod's square or they die on it.
* Vek will not actively destroy the pod but sometimes AOE damages might happen to cover the tile. Vek sometimes walk onto pods even if it is rare. It can cause you to not be able to 100% an island.
* [[Allied Units]], such as the [[Renfield Bomb]], can collect a pod if they're pushed or walk onto it.
*An attacking beetle Vek will not destroy a pod if its attack passes over the pod.
*If the pod is on a tile that is submerged by a broken [[Old Earth Dam]], the pod will be destroyed.

== First Time Players ==
The main aim of the game is to defeat all [[Vek]] threats on 2, 3, or 4 of the [[Islands]], and then defeat the [[Volcanic Hive]].  The broader aims are; 
* Unlock all of the [[Squads|mech squads]], which is done by spending coins earned from completing in game [[achievements]].
* Unlock all [[Pilots|mech pilots]], which are found randomly in time pods, or randomly awarded upon perfect completion of an island.

At the end of each play through of the game, you will be asked which of your 3 mech pilots you want to take to the next time line.  Initially it's best to select the same pilot for each game: between games they will increase in experience and gain new skills, making each subsequent play through easier. Maxing out your first pilot's experience will earn you an achievement (and a coin).

Pay attention to the achievements specific to your squad, each will earn you a coin.  At the start of the game, you will only have access to the [[Rift Walkers]], so attempt to complete these achievements in your play through:
* Drown 3 enemies in water in a single battle
* Kill an enemy 5 or more tiles away with a Dash Punch
* Complete the first Corporate Island

Maxing out your pilot and completing the first corporate island are fairly easy first goals, and they will earn you enough coins to unlock the [[Rusting Hulks]].

== Missions ==
* When choosing which missions to pursue on an island, a good way to prioritize is by risk/difficulty vs reward.  Consider [[Reactor Core|Reactor cores]] the most valuable reward, and power the least valuable; this is because reactor cores cost 3 reputation.  Power costs one reputation, however reputation is more valuable because it can also be spent on other things when power is not needed. Do note that missions with Reactor Cores usually tend to have 3 objectives though, which have an extra enemy spawned and are thus more difficult. You will need to weigh your decision based on how low your power is, and how difficult the mission is.
* Once you unlock the rest of the islands, take a look at the Vek types when choosing which islands to attempt and what order to attempt them in. In particular, the Psion and Leader Vek can make a big difference in the island's difficulty, depending on your chosen Squad's abilities.
* Similarly, try to choose missions that fit the abilities of your Mechs. For example, Missions that require you to protect something are easier if you have shields or ice, but these don't help much if you're required to kill a large number of enemies.
* Achieving all bonus objectives in an island will give you an extra reward. Keep in mind Time Pods are also considered as bonus objectives.
* Depending on how much power you have, when deciding between protecting an objective and a city; it is not always better to protect the city.  This is because damage to the city means you will lose power that you already have, whilst the loss of an objective carries a heavy opportunity cost.
** Losing a perfect island bonus also means missing out on a new pilot, weapon, or 2 reputation/repair so consider the situation carefully before you decide. Unless your grid power is dangerously low, it's probably better to sacrifice the building and repair the grid power later rather than miss out on a significant bonus at the end of the island.

== Combat ==
* Mechs can be repaired easily, and are repaired for free at the end of a mission.  This often means that it is preferable for a Mech to take a hit instead of a building or objective; as long as the Mech survives by the end of the mission, the pilot will not die.
* Similarly, Mechs can be used to form walls to push Vek into.  This can turn a non-damaging push into a damaging one.
* Friendly fire sometimes makes sense.  For example, a mech stuck in a web can sometimes be freed by being hit by artillery.
* Consider how attacks can push friendly units around. The positive is that it can be used to break them out of webs or to increase a friendly unit's range. The negative is that it might prevent the unit from attacking (e.g. pushing it into water).
* As long as you don't actually use an ability (a weapon or repair action), you can undo as many moves as you want.
* Being too aggressive about preventing reinforcements early can create a nightmare in later turns when six Vek emerge at once. It can be better to neutralize a Vek than to block reinforcements, so focus on that first.  However, enemies do not spawn before the final turn, so you can prevent an enemy from spawning by blocking it over multiple turns.
* Use the environment against the Vek as much as possible: push them into mountains, each other, water, lava, and over spawning holes.  Every passive source of damage is a HP that you don't need to remove with a Mech.
* Psions don't do direct damage but passively increase the abilities of other Vek.  Taking them out early is often a good strategy, provided no other enemies are threatening the grid.  However, consider how they can be used to your advantage as well. For example:
** [[Blast Psion]] causes enemies to explode on death, but can be used to damage other enemy Vek.
** [[Shell Psion]] defend against weapon attacks but they do not block other sources of damage; squads that use indirect damage such as the [[Flame Behemoths]] can often ignore them.
* Study the turn order (found in the top right of the UI), it goes: environment, Fire/Electric damage, Vek attacks, NPC action, new Vek spawn.  It will also tell you the order in which each Vek attacks.  Use this information to get them to hit each other, and determine where they will end their turns.
** Any Vek with 1 HP who are also on fire will die before they act.
* Often it pays to not collect time pods by standing on them.  Time pods are recovered at the end of the mission as long as they are not destroyed (or walked on by a Vek), and Vek don't usually target them.  Not spending a turn to go collect them means that it can be spent doing something else.

== Progression ==
* It is often more valuable to spend reactor cores on your mechs' inbuilt abilities than it is to buy new weapons (depending on the weapon and cost).
* When buying [[weapons]], consider how useful it actually will be as opposed to buying a reactor core for more health, movement or upgrades to your current weapons or pilot abilities. A weapon costs 2 reputation while a reactor core costs 3 reputation to buy, but note that some weapons require 1 or 2 reactor cores to power.
* Improving movement allows your team more flexibility on the map.  Being able to move further in one turn is crucial for adapting to new threats across the board. However, consider using weapons which also move the mech, as they have much greater range than walking does.
* Improving HP will increase your team's ability to do many of the tips in the combat section, such as shielding buildings, or acting as walls.
* XP is quite important in this game, as your pilots learn a new ability each time they level up (up to a max of two). It's worth giving all your pilots a chance to level up.
** If one of your pilots is at max level already while others are struggling, consider swapping that pilot into a Mech which rarely kills enemies. That way the other pilot will get a chance to kill extra enemies and gain some XP.
* Passive ability weapons can be very useful, as for a single cost/slot the whole team benefits.
* If you replace a weapon or a pilot, consider selling the old one.  You are likely to earn between about 4-10 reputation per island, unused items can be sold for 1 reputation, and can be game changing when you only need 1 more reputation to do something.
* On the other hand, consider saving up one extra Pilot in case one of the primary pilots die, or if you want to carry over reputation to the next island. Similarly, you can buy weapons at the first island shop, and sell them later to also carry over reputation.</text>

==Strategy==
Titan Fist is a well balanced weapon that provides good single target damage, enemy displacement and mobility when '''Dash''' is upgraded. Titan Fist is one of the best weapons to acquire when the squad lacks damage output. However, it does not out perform other damage dealing weapons in Prime class. It also lacks potential to resolve 2+ Vek threats at once.

The '''Titanite Blade''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into The Breach]]. It is not a starting weapon of any [[Mechs|Mech]], but it be obtained through a [[Time Pod]] or a reputation reward.

==Description==
Swing a massive sword to damage and push 3 tiles. Single-use.

This attack deals 2 damage by default.
===Class===
Prime.

==Strategy==

Titanite Blade is somewhat similar to [[Mercury Fist]], in that they are both limited use high damage prime weapons. Since it always hits 3 tiles directly in front of the Mech, it is recommended to pair the Titanite Blade with upgrades and pilots that offer more movement, to get the most flexible firing angles and limit friendly fire.

Titanite Blade is a natural pick for mobile Prime Mechs whose main weapon is utility/displacement purpose, such as the [[Judo Mech]] and [[Aegis Mech]], or similarly mobile Mechs outside Prime class.

      <text bytes="3379" sha1="1np81u9x08va19mrgp7bp4juotz0nwt" xml:space="preserve">In Into The Breach, there are many traits that both enemy and player units have. This page does not cover pilot [[skills]] despite them being listed as traits in-game. 
== Armored ==
[[File:Icon armor.png|thumb]]
Armored is a trait that enemy, player, and objective units have. It decreases incoming weapon damage by 1, applied to each source individually. This notably does not apply to any other source, only to direct weapon damage, meaning push damage, explosion damage, spawn blocking, fire damage, and electric smoke damage are not reduced.

[[Judo Mech]], [[Hook Mech]], [[Armored Train]], and [[Bouncer Leader]] all innately have armored

[[Shell Psion]] grants other vek (and the player if they have [https://intothebreach.fandom.com/wiki/Passives#Psionic%20Receiver Psionic Receiver]) armored

[[Abe Isamu]] grants any mech he pilots armored (does not stack if the mech already has it)
== Volatile / Explosive Decay ==
[[File:Icon explosive decay.png|thumb]]
Volatile is a trait that only enemy and objective units have. It makes it so that when the unit is destroyed, it explodes, dealing 1 damage to nearby tiles. This damage ignores armor

[[Volatile Vek]] and [[Renfield Bomb|Prototype Renfield Bombs]] innately have volatile

[[Blast Psion]] grants other vek (and the player if they have Psionic Receiver) volatile
== Flying ==
[[File:Icon flying.png|thumb]]
Flying is a trait that player and enemy units have. It prevents the unit from falling into chasms, water, lava, and A.C.I.D. pools, making them hover over instead, and allows the unit to move through both enemies and objects such as buildings and mountains

[[Hornet]], [[Alpha Hornet]], [[Hornet Leader]], [[Mosquito]], [[Alpha Mosquito]], [[Mosquito Leader]], [[Moth]], [[Alpha Moth]], Shell Psion, Blast Psion, [[Soldier Psion]], [[Blood Psion]], [[Smoldering Psion]], [[Arachnid Psion]], [[Raging Psion]], [[Psion Tyrant]], [[Psion Abomination]], [[Jet Mech]], [[Swap Mech]], [[Defense Mech]], [[Ice Mech]], [[Nano Mech]], [[Thruster Mech]], [[Control Mech]], [[Drill Mech]], and [[Techno-Hornet]] all have flying innately

[[Prospero]] can grant any mech they're in flying for 1 power core
== Massive ==
[[File:Icon massive.png|thumb]]
Massive is a trait that only enemy units have, though all player units functionally have it. Massive makes a unit affected by it unable to drown, and will instead sit in liquids without dying. Liquids will, however, cancel attacks. Any boss enemy without flying has massive to prevent them from being insta-killed with liquids. They can still be killed with chasms

[[Scorpion Leader]], [[Scarab Leader]],  [[Beetle Leader]], [[Firefly Leader]], [[Large Goo]], [[Medium Goo]], [[Small Goo]], [[Spider Leader]], [[Crab Leader]], [[Blobber Leader]], [[Bouncer Leader]], [[Centipede Leader]], [[Gastropod Leader]], [[Plasmodia Leader]], [[Mosquito Leader]], [[Starfish Leader]], and [[Tumblebug Leader]] all have massive
== Stable ==
[[File:Icon guard glow.png|thumb]]
Stable is a rare trait that only enemy and objective units have. Stable makes a unit completely immune to all forms of displacement, including push, pull, and teleporting effects.

[[Burrower]], [[Alpha Burrower]], [[Terraformer]], [[Disposal Unit]], [[Detritus Contraption]], [[Shield Generator]], [[Hacking Station]], [[Supply Train|Train]], [[Armored Train]], and [[Earth Mover]] all have stable</text>

'''Triptych Mech''' is a Ranged-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Cataclysm]] squad.
==Strategy==
Due to Tri-Rocket's multi-target damage, the Triptych mech benefits from a pilot that grants Boost, such as [[Kai Miller]], [[Morgan Lejeune]] or another pilot with a Boost [[Skills#Advanced Edition|skill]].

The 3-tile range lets the Triptych Mech target the tile directly in front of its attack range and push away webbing melee Vek if it needs to. In its Cataclysm squad, the rockets can be used to crack tiles while pushing an enemy into the created chasm. In general, the multi-targeting also adds a lot of bump damage in tight corners (though beware of pushing enemies into buildings). Both upgrades are useful; '''Buildings Immune''' can be helpful for letting the Triptych fire from more flexible spots, and '''+1 Damage''' will allow its damage to scale on well on the multiple targets it hits. However, prioritize the other Mechs if playing with Cataclysm, as their upgrades offer more value for the squad to create more chasms.

==Trivia==
A [[wikipedia:Triptych|triptych]] is an artwork divided into three pieces or sections.

}}The '''Tumblebug''' is a rare [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the Advanced Edition. They are only present if Advanced Enemies are turned on at the start of a new timeline.
==Description==
Tumblebugs attack by summoning an [[Unstable Boulder]] that will explode when damaged, then threatening to damage it and inflict 1 damage on all of its adjancent tiles, including the Tumblebug. These boulders do not explode if they are not damaged. If a Tumblebug is forced to attack a mech directly it will not summon an unstable boulder.

As a rare Vek, Tumblebugs cannot appear on the first island and are restricted to two spawns per mission, including its [[Alpha Tumblebug|alpha]]. They cannot spawn on missions with [[Old Earth Mine|explosive mines]].

==Strategy==
Tumblebugs are notorious for either placing their Unstable Boulders next to many buildings at once and blocking grounded Mech movement, or in an open space where it will not damage anything significant. If they do the former, try to push the Tumblebug away from the boulder or eliminate it with a strong attack; Smoking them can be effective as well since it will discourage them from attacking their Unstable Boulders in future turns. If they do the latter, you can move your Mechs out of the way to focus on more dangerous Vek and let it damage itself; or if you can spare an action, use weapons that damage and push the Tumblebug into its own boulder, which will cause additional bump damage and explosive decay damage.

When deploying against Tumblebugs, try to encourage them to put their Unstable Boulders in an open space next to your Mechs; much like [[Blobber|Blobbers]], they will attempt to attack as many targets as possible, so offer them two Mechs to attack with no buildings around if it does not compromise positioning.

Even after the Tumblebug is eliminated, Unstable Boulders will remain around and become a nuisance to deal with, so make sure to move them away from grid buildings and shield or freeze them so that they endure enough hits to not explode. Note that other enemy Vek will not target explosive boulders; only Tumblebugs will attempt to target existing unstable boulders again. However, it will not stop enemies with multi-target range like [[Centipede|Centipedes]] or [[Alpha Hornet|Alpha Hornets]] from additionally targeting Unstable Boulders, if they will also target a Mech or a building.

It's worth putting off an island with Tumblebugs until later in the timeline if you don't think your current weapon set is sufficient to neutralize them. In particular, be very careful with Tumblebugs in missions with environmental effects, such as '''Air Strikes''' from [[Archive, Inc.]] or '''Conveyor Belts''' from [[Detritus Disposal]], as these effects can also destroy or place boulders in inconvenient spots.

}}The '''Tumblebug Leader''' is a boss [[Vek]] from ''[[Into The Breach]]'' introduced in the Advanced Edition. They only appear if Advanced Enemies are on at the start of a new timeline.
==Description==
The Tumblebug Leader attacks by spawning two '''Unstable Boulders''' in front of it and threatening to attack the tile in front for 3 damage. Unstable Boulders have the explosive decay effect, making them capable of damaging multiple buildings when just one of them sets off. These boulders also do not die off when the Tumblebug Leader is killed and remain as obstacles. If a Tumblebug has no space to make boulders it will simply attack an adjacent tile directly.

Tumblebug Leaders cannot spawn on the [[Volcanic Hive]], like most Advanced Edition Vek. They also cannot spawn on missions with [[Old Earth Mine|explosive mines]], even if [[Archive, Inc.]] has them in the 4th island on Unfair difficulty.
==Strategy==
This boss is easily the hardest leader out of all other Vek, as not only can it damage multiple buildings with one attack but also generate dangerous obstacles that are near-impossible to safely remove. Luring it out to open areas without any opportunity to damage buildings is the best way to defeat it, as you can damage and push the leader into the boulders without losing any grid. For layouts that do not have this option, make sure you get two mechs that can hit it in range before the boulders enclose them off.

Just as with the [[Alpha Tumblebug]], note that only the Tumblebug Leader's attack deals 3 damage; the explosion from its Unstable Boulders still deals 1 damage to surrounding targets.

'''Unbreakable''' is one of the [[achievements]] in [[Into the Breach]]. Using the [[Steel Judoka]] squad, the player must absorb 5 damage with armor in a single battle.

==Strategy==
This achievement is best done in the first island, when alpha enemies are less common, and preferably in a [[missions|mission]] that lasts for 5 turns.

Since the only mech in the squad that has natural armor is the Judo Mech, the set-up can be made easier by starting the timeline with [[Abe Isamu]] piloting the Gravity Mech.

'''Unstable Mech''' is a Brute-class [[mechs|mech]] in ''[[Into the Breach]]''.
==Team==
The mech is available as part of the [[Hazardous Mechs]] squad.
==Strategy==
The Unstable Mechs weapon will self damage it with every use, and will additionally knock it backwards one tile. If using it outside of the Hazardous Mechs in a [[Custom Squad]], it is recommended to pair it with Pilots such as [[Mafan]] or [[Abe Isamu]], or Mechs with destruction prevention equipment such as the [[Defense Mech]] or [[Smog Mech]]. Note that the self damage is also treated as an attack at the Mech's current tile; thus, it will ignite forest tiles or break ice and cracked tiles that the Mech is currently occupying. The only way to prevent this is if the Unstable Mech is shielded; in which case, the shield will absorb the self-damage to the Mech and tile.

The knockback from Unstable Cannon can be useful for getting additional bump damage on enemies behind it, as long as the self-damage and bump damage are mitigated. It can be particularly useful at dealing with [[Blobber]] enemies and their [[Blob|Blobs]] in a single action, using the projectile to hit the Blobber and the knockback damage to destroy the Blob. Additionally, the knockback can be used to fire from unsafe tiles, such as those projecting a '''Lightning Strike''', as the Unstable Cannon will push it back and away from that tile. It's wise to invest on additional movement for the Unstable Mech first, as the knockback moving the Mech backwards can also push it further back away from enemy spawns.

'''Untouchable''' is one of the [[achievements]] in [[Into the Breach]].

==Notes==
Since this achievement requires taking no Mech Damage at all, it is best done with squads that don't rely on self-damaging weapons or are prone to friendly fire. Starting the timeline with a pilot that can absorb damage is recommended, such as [[Abe Isamu]]'s natural armor or a pilot with access to a shield ([[Bethany Jones]], [[Adam]], or [[Mafan]]).

Consider doing this achievement with the [[Rusting Hulks]] for efficiency, as they have the [[Perfect Battle]] achievement which can be gotten as part of getting Untouchable. Best done early in the timeline and on easier difficulties as well, since this achievement naturally limits blocking spawns.

The '''Vek''' are the main enemies encountered in ''[[Into The Breach]]''.

==Gameplay==
The main goal of Into the Breach is to make sure that the Vek do not destroy all of the grid power. Each island has a set variety of Vek that can spawn, one of which is a Psion, a supporting unit that grants a passive bonus to others. They emerge from the ground on certain tiles, which can be intercepted at the cost of 1 health during the enemy turn.

Before the player turn any active Vek will move to a certain tile and prepare to attack it, aiming for either a mech, building or objective. These attacks are executed during the enemy turn unless they are cancelled or the Vek is killed beforehand.

Vek are divided into five main groups:

*'''Common''' Vek are those that can spawn on any island and make up most of the spawns on a mission. All of them have a soft limit on spawns per mission that can be bypassed if the spawning algorithm needs to.
* '''Rare''' Vek are those whose attacks are more unique than common ones and do not appear on early islands.
*'''Psions''', which provide passive bonuses to other Vek when spawned. Note that the Psion itself does not benefit from the passive bonus.
*'''Minor''' Vek, which are spawned by other Vek, are typically very weak, and bypass the spawning algorithm. They are not worth any experience and are not affected by Psion bonuses.
*Hive '''Leaders''', bosses found on the final mission of each island, the [[Volcanic Hive]] and normal missions on the fourth island in Unfair difficulty.

Rare Vek and Psions have a hard limit on spawns that cannot be bypassed, with Psions in particular being able to spawn only once per mission. Each island has three species of common Vek that can spawn as well as one type of psion, with rare species appearing the further you are in a run.

Alpha Vek are upgraded versions of Vek with higher health and stronger attack, spawning in place of any Vek that has one while contributing to the same spawn limit. They will appear more depending on a timeline's progression and difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/IntoTheBreach/comments/d38p5f/discussion_vekspawning_logic_and_differences/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Vek appear mainly insectoid in nature and behavior, forming a hive and reproducing via [[Vek Egg Sack|eggs]]. Exceptions among them include [[Large Goo|goo-like lifeforms]] or species resembling Earth sealife (such as the jellyfish-like Psions, and a variety of Vek introduced in [[Advanced Edition]]).
The Vek's origin and motives are left unexplained. However, their psionic powers and ability to [[Bot Leader|hijack technology]] hints that they are more than mere rampaging beasts.

==Trivia==
*The code associated with each mission in the game shows no indication that the same Vek will appear on any given mission. Instead, it appears that the Vek are randomly chosen from the island's pool each time the player enters a mission.
*Unimplemented sprites exist for leader versions of the Burrower, Leaper, Digger and Moth:

The '''Vice Fist''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into the Breach]]. It is the starting weapon of the [[Judo Mech]].

==Description==
Grab a unit and toss it behind you.

Deals 1 damage to start. The Mech ''must'' have an unoccupied tile behind them to throw the enemy onto; the weapon will not be able to fire otherwise.
===Class===
Prime.

===Upgrades===
* '''Ally Immune''' {{template:1power}}
* '''+2 Damage''' {{template:3power}}

==Strategy==
Vice Fist has minimal damage among the Prime weapons, and its unique throw over-the-head displacement arc requires an unoccupied space behind the Mech for the target to land on. This can often be problematic in tight corners, as the weapon cannot be activated without an unoccupied space. Vice Fist also cannot fire on stable targets like [[Burrower|Burrowers]].

The upgrades are generally not a high priority; '''Ally Immunity''' is extremely situational to be worth it, while the damage increase still only caps its damage at 3, not enough to destroy most Alpha enemies without the use of [[A.C.I.D.]]. Instead of relying on Vice Fist's damage, it is instead best to use the weapon to reposition enemies so that they get caught in the way of other attacks, or so they land on environmental tiles (such as [[Forest Tile|forests]]) and trigger the environmental effect with the damage.

The Judo Mech, however, is a decent mech in terms of stats, as it has natural armor and 4 movement. Getting an alternative weapon should be high priority of playing Judo Mech, to offer it more options when it cannot use Vice Fist.

'''Viscera Nanobots''' is a [[Passives|passive]] equipment in the game [[Into The Breach]]. It is part of the starting loadout for the [[Nano Mech]]. It is also obtainable as an Island Reward, through the Corporate Reputation Store, or through a [[Time Pod]].

==Description==
Mechs heal 1 damage when they deal a killing blow.

Repairing Mechs happens ''after'' all damage calculations have been performed. A Mech that hits 0HP from an attack which disables them will be repaired back online if they also get at least 1 kill.

The amount of health healed will correspond to the number of enemies killed as well; for example, an attack that kills two enemies will heal the Mech for 1 + 1 = 2 HP without upgrades to the passive, or 2 + 2 = 4 HP if the passive has been upgraded.
===Class===
Any.

===Upgrades===
* '''+1 Heal''' {{template:2power}} - Increases healing to 2.

==Strategy==
Viscera Nanobots is what help keeps the [[Hazardous Mechs]] online. The additional '''+1 Heal''' upgrade is optional to get; as long as the Mech gets a kill, they will be healed back to 1 HP at least without upgrades, so it's not necessary for preventing Mechs being disabled. That said, it's worth considering the upgrade so that the Mechs in the squad can reliably tank spawn blocking damage; especially when considering the '''+1 Damage Each''' upgrades to both of the other Mechs weapons.

Outside of its home squad, Viscera Nanobots is a lot more situational. It could help other similar Mechs, like the [[Charge Mech]] or the [[Thruster Mech]] in a [[Custom Squad]], from destroying themselves with their weapons. Most notably, it is very strong with [[Self-Destruct]], as the instant-kill damage guarantees that the Mech using it will be repaired back up. But if the player is not using Mechs or weapons like these in conjunction with the Nano Mech, it is recommended to sell Viscera Nanobots later in the timeline for Reputation; particularly when it makes the difference to buy an additional Reactor Core.

The '''Volatile Vek''' is one of the [[Vek]] from [[Into The Breach]]. It is unique in that it only spawns on missions that involve not killing it.

==Description==
Identical to the standard [[Scorpion]], except it has 4 health.

==Strategy==
The Volatile Vek's main purpose is to '''survive the mission.''' Killing it will deal 1 damage to adjacent tiles, much like a Vek under the effects of the [[Blast Psion]]; the player will not claim reputation if it is defeated. Effort has to be directed to push the Vek away from its target each turn, unless it can be frozen and left on pause so that all Mechs can concentrate on surviving the mission.

Note that the Volatile Vek still benefits from Psions; so if it is paired in an island with the [[Blood Psion]], it can be pushed by a damaging non-fatal attack should it target the grid, while still getting passively healed each turn.

The '''Volcanic Hive''' is the location of the final mission of a timeline in [[Into the Breach]]. 

==Description==
The Volcanic Hive is initially hidden and only becomes accessible after the second island is complete. The final mission, '''The Last Stand,''' takes place on this island and is divided into two phases that must be survived to save a timeline. The psion that spawns on this island is the [[Psion Tyrant]].

Except for Vek Leaders in a 3 or 4 island Unfair difficulty playthrough, no Advanced Edition Vek can spawn on this island, even if Advanced Enemies are on. Only the following Vek and their Alphas can spawn in the final mission&lt;ref name = "deep_diving_inside_final_mission"&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/IntoTheBreach/comments/dhxkzv/discussion_diving_deep_inside_the_final_mission/ Final Mission data], note that this data was compiled before the Advanced Edition&lt;/ref&gt;:
* [[Firefly|Fireflies]]
* [[Hornet|Hornets]]
* [[Scarab|Scarabs]]
* [[Scorpion|Scorpions]] (Limited to one)
* [[Crab|Crabs]]
* [[Beetle|Beetles]]
* [[Digger|Diggers]]
* [[Blobber|Blobbers]]

It's possible in Unfair difficulty for one boss variant of the above enemies (if they have one) to be present in the final mission, during a 3 or 4 island playthrough. This can include Vek leaders that were added as part of the Advanced Edition, if the option for these enemies was enabled for that timeline.&lt;ref name = "unfair_volcanic_hive"&gt;[https://imgur.com/a/fULx2eT screenshots of Unfair difficulty Volcanic Hive], shows a Beetle and Crab leader in 2nd phase of battle&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surface ==
The first part occurs on the surface of the Volcanic Hive. The map varies, but always starts with no grid buildings and one '''Super Volcano'''. On hard difficulty, a Vek leader will be present; two will be present on Unfair 3 and 4 island playthroughs. The possible bosses in the surface include&lt;ref name = "deep_diving_inside_final_mission" /&gt;:
* [[Firefly Leader]]
* [[Hornet Leader]]
* [[Scorpion Leader]] (not affected by regular and Alpha Scorpion limit)

Note that the above restriction only applies to the first boss in the attack turn order; the second boss can be a variant of any standard enemy listed above.&lt;ref name = "unfair_volcanic_hive" /&gt;

CEO [[Jessica Kern|Kern]] of the [[R.S.T. Corporation]] deploys Power Pylons after deployment, but before the battle begins. Power Pylons provide Grid Power and should be protected just like Civilian Buildings. If the Power Grid is destroyed, the timeline is lost and it's game over.

The Super Volcano alternates between a Lava Flow, which converts some surface tiles to lava tiles, and Volcanic Projectiles. Any unit that is standing on a tile marked by a Volcanic Projectile at the end of the turn is destroyed at the start of the next turn. The Lava Flow and Volcanic Projectiles never target tiles with Power Pylons.

After 5 turns, seismic activity strikes, creating a huge crater which sends all mechs underground, beginning the second phase.

Any Mechs disabled during the first phase are restored at the start of the second, underground phase, but with basic A.I. pilots.

[[File:Volcanic-hive-part-1.png|border|center|frameless|400x400px|Volcanic Hive - Surface]]

== Underground ==
The second part of '''The Last Stand''' occurs underground in the Volcanic Hive. The map is composed of mountains in the form of stalagmites, ground and lava tiles with no grid buildings. 4-5 Vek are initially present, including a Vek leader which is always present on any difficulty. On Unfair, two leaders spawn during a 3 or 4 island playthrough. The possible bosses in the underground include&lt;ref name = "deep_diving_inside_final_mission" /&gt;:
* [[Firefly Leader]]
* [[Hornet Leader]]
* [[Beetle Leader]]

Note that the above restriction only applies to the first boss in the attack turn order; the second boss can be a variant of any standard enemy listed above.&lt;ref name = "unfair_volcanic_hive" /&gt;

Unlike most battles, your squad is automatically deployed in a group near the upper corner of the map. [[Gana]]'s Preemptive Strike ability can still do 1 damage to adjacent Vek if it happens to land near a Vek.  

Additional Power Pylons are deployed by CEO Kern, as well as a Renfield Bomb, which must be protected for 5 turns until it arms itself, destroying the Volcanic Hive. The bomb is deployed adjacent with the mechs forming a 2x2 square. If a 5th Vek is present, the Renfield bomb will fall on top of it, killing the Vek; if that enemy happens to have a cap on spawning, such as a [[Blobber]], it will contribute to the cap and can prevent it from appearing. Unlike the ones found on R.S.T. island, this bomb has 4 health and does not explode upon being destroyed.

If the Renfield Bomb is destroyed, a replacement Renfield Bomb is deployed and 2 turns are added to the turn counter so the replacement bomb has time to arm itself. This happens every time the Renfield Bomb is destroyed until the Renfield Bomb has time to arm itself and detonate.

The environmental effect is called Caverns. It alternates between Falling Rocks and Tentacles. Any unit in a tile marked by Falling Rocks or Tentacles at the end of a turn is destroyed at the start of the next turn. Falling Rocks fill in lava tiles. The Tentacles target the tiles where the Mechs were located at the start of the turn, then on the enemy turn tentacles burst through the ground creating a lava tile and dealing KILL damage to any unit that was there. Falling Rocks and Tentacles never target the Renfield Bomb, but the Renfield Bomb can be destroyed by pushing the bomb into the path of Falling Rocks or Tentacles.

Every fourth turn a line of Tentacles divides the area, but skips over the Renfield Bomb.

The battle can only be won if the Renfield Bomb survives the last turn. Vek do not come out of spawn points if the bomb survived the Vek attack phase during the final turn. This means that the bomb will not be destroyed if it is blocking a Vek spawn at 1 health.

[[File:Volcanic-hive-2.png|border|center|frameless|400x400px]]

==Strategy==
Use the environment to your advantage.  There are a lot of hazards that will insta-kill any unit standing there, so take advantage of repositioning enemy Vek on to those hazards.

On the second turn of the underground phase, tentacles will target your mechs, killing any unit there.  So on the first turn of the underground phase, think about the positioning of your mechs, and if possible place them where the tentacle targets will be most useful: usually on top of a Vek spawn point that will then be eliminated by turning it into lava, in front of a pylon to block melee attackers, in a convenient bottleneck to block enemy movement, or just out of the way.

As always, if you lose your power grid, you lose the game. However, taking hits to your power pylons does not reduce your score.  If it comes down to it, prioritize protecting your last power grid point over the Renfield Bomb, but also remember that you only need one surviving power to win the game.

== Trivia ==

* The Super Volcano cannot be destroyed usually, but will seperate into three mountains if one tile is converted into a liquid tile by the [[Flood Drill]].

Damage and Push all adjacent tiles to the left.

Deals 2 damage to all targets, and 1 self damage to the user.

===Class===
Prime.
===Upgrades===
* '''-1 Self Damage''' (1 Reactor Core {{template:1power}}) - Reduces the damage the Mech takes when using this weapon by 1.
* '''+1 Damage''' (3 Reactor Cores {{template:3power}}) - Increases the damage to targets by 1.

==Strategy==
Vortex Fist is a mixed version of [[Hydraulic Legs]] with [[Sidewinder Fist]]'s pushing angle. Just like the former, it can deal 3 damage in a cross shape around the Mech, plus 1 push on full upgrade. Compared to Hydraulic Legs, Vortex Fist has 2 less self damage with max upgrades, but it loses positioning without mobility oriented upgrades and pilot abilities. The sideways push of Vortex Fist somewhat sets it apart, as most weapons do not have versatile pushing, and thus can offer alternative positioning options if the self damage and friendly fire can be mitigated.

The '''Vulcan Artillery''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into The Breach]]. It is the starting weapon of the [[Meteor Mech]].

==Description==
Light the target on [[Fire]] and push adjacent tiles.
===Class===
Ranged.
===Upgrades===
* '''Backburn''' (1 Reactor Core {{template:1power}}) - Light the tile behind the Mech on Fire.
* '''+2 Damage''' (3 Reactor Cores {{template:3power}}) - Adds 2 damage to targeted tiles.
===Availability===

==Strategy==
Much like [[Artemis Artillery]], the Vulcan Artillery weapon can be used to push up to four units away from the target tile. Since the weapon deals no direct damage, [[Civilian Building|buildings]] can be targeted without harming them; setting them on [[Fire]] alone does not damage them. 
Vulcan Artillery can work well as a utility option outside of the [[Flame Behemoths]] as well, even off-class due to its immediate utility without any upgrades; though caution should be exercised to ensure that the fire itself does not hurt the players Mech positioning.

The '''Backburn''' upgrade gives Vulcan Artillery a way to address another target at melee range; and note that the '''+2 Damage''' upgrade will also affect the Backburn tile and let the Mech deal 2 damage up-close. However, powering the Damage upgrade will start to damage buildings as well; so this upgrade should be carefully considered, weighing if the damage increase is worth losing utility.

The '''Water Tile''' is one of the [[Tiles]] in [[Into The Breach]].

==Notes==
Flying units are not affected by water.  [[Abilities and status effects|Massive]] units, which include all player Mechs and boss Vek, can stand in water but cannot attack.  If a unit is on fire, it will be put out.  

Terrestrial enemies with [[Abilities_and_status_effects|Explosive Decay]] will still explode on death, damaging adjacent tiles, when pushed into water.

If a specific Mech pushes a Vek into the water to kill it, it will gain all its XP.  If a Vek is pushed or falls into water from indirect sources, its XP will be split between the squad.

If this tile is hit with a freeze effect, it will turn into an [[Ice Tile]].

}}
'''Watery Grave''' is one of the [[achievements]] in [[Into the Breach]].

==Notes==
To count as a successful drowning, the enemy must be pushed into water without taking lethal damage.

There are two missions in [[Archive, Inc.]] that make this achievement easier to get; any with the '''Tidal Waves''' environmental effect, and '''Destroy the [[Old Earth Dam|Dam]]'''.

The various '''Weapons''' from [[Into The Breach]].

==Description==
Each of the [[Mechs]] have a Weapon equipped, and will do different things depending on how you want to use them. Note that all weapons have friendly fire ON (unless an exception is mentioned) so if you don't plan properly you can damage your own Mechs. 

Most weapons come with an upgrade or two, at the cost of additional [[Reactor Core]] usage. Upgrades are not purchased separately from their base weapons, they are included. 

'''Note that powering Upgrade 1 is never a prerequisite for powering Upgrade 2.'''

The '''Wind Torrent''' is one of the [[weapons]] in the game [[Into The Breach]]. It is not a starting weapon of any [[Mechs|Mech]], but obtainable as a reputation reward or through a [[Time Pod]].

==Description==
Push all units in a single direction. Single-use.

===Class===
Any.

===Upgrades===
* '''Unlimited Uses''' (1 Reactor Core {{template:1power}}) - Removes use restriction in battles.

===Availability===

==Strategy==
Wind Torrent is one of the best utility weapons in the game. With a surprisingly low reactor core cost for '''Unlimited Uses''', the global displacement ability always resolves multiple Vek threats in one use. Webs are also broken during the movement, and can move multiple Veks into hazardous or friendly fire tiles. Before using it however, pay attention to where every enemy and ally will be shifted towards, to avoid bumping into buildings and objectives, and move your Mechs as needed.

* Pre-Mission
** "A fragile ecosystem of new machine life is evolving on the silicate plains here. If too many Vek break through, the ecosystem will be devastated."
** "The local coolant station detonated, releasing storms of cryo-nanites into the atmosphere. Avoid them or your Mechs may be flash-frozen."
** "Threat Diagnostic: Machines: Frozen. Threat: Very high. I recommend you avoid them."
** "I calculate there are still three hundred and seventy-three cryo-mines in this area intended for pacification of hostile machines. Keep your sensors on high."
** "These factories are manufacturing hostile machines, but there are hundreds of innocent lives within. Please defend them while we try to shut them down safely."

The '''Zenith Guard''' is one of the [[Squads]] from [[Into The Breach]], unlockable for 2 coins. They consist of the [[Laser Mech]], [[Charge Mech]] and [[Defense Mech]].

The Zenith Guard has heavy firepower early on in the Laser Mech's Burst Beam and the Charge Mech's Ramming Engines. However, Ramming Engines' self-damage means that the Defense Mech must frequently deploy shields to prevent it from killing itself. The shields are also important for preventing collateral damage from the Burst Beam and for protecting against Vek attacks.

==Achievements==
;[[Get Over Here]]: Kill an enemy by pulling it into yourself
;[[Glittering C-Beam]]: Hit 4 enemies with a single laser
;[[Shield Mastery]]: Block damage with a Shield 4 times in a single battle

== Strategies ==

* The Laser Mech demands open column and row space to work at its peak efficiency. If enclosed by buildings your Defense Mech must encase them in shields before you fire.
* The front two tiles of the burst beam will take 3 and 2 damage respectively, enough to kill all normal Vek apart from the [[Beetle]]. When upgraded the distribution becomes 4-3-2 from your mech, which can kill the [[Alpha Scarab]], [[Alpha Gastropod]] and [[Alpha Bouncer]].
* The Charge Mech only inflicts self-damage if it hits anything. Using it to arrive on empty space can substitute for its low movement and lets it cross chasms.
** Beware of the self-damage if inflicted with A.C.I.D. or a damage Boost, as they will double the self-damage taken.
* Look for the [[Force Amp]] passive, as it allows the Charge Mech deal 4 damage to a Vek without any upgrades, as well as making the Defense Mech deal 2 damage when pulling into itself.
* Since the Charge Mech damages itself every time it attacks, it's recommended to choose one of the following Pilots to start the timeline with:
** [[Abe Isamu]] removes the self-damage from the Charge Mech, and allows him to spam Ramming Engines with no drawback.
** [[Ariadne]] increases the Charge Mech's health to 6 - enough to survive all 5 turns of a battle - and enables her to attack at [[Forest Tile|forests]] without setting the Charge Mech on fire.
** [[Mafan]]'s Zoltan Shield allows him to spend it using Ramming Engines every turn, provided he doesn't take damage or gets set on fire for the enemy turn. The extra reactor can also be used to immediately power Ramming Engine's damage; the increased self-damage isn't an issue since the shield absorbs it already without damaging tiles either.
* For pilots obtained through the run, noteworthy ones to look for include:
** [[Harold Schmidt]] and [[Kazaaakpleth]] can give the Defense Mech a much better pushing tool in addition to its default Attraction Pulse.
** [[Kai Miller]] and [[Morgan Lejeune]] both raise the maximum damage of the Laser Mech to 5, which is enough to kill most Alphas.
** [[Silica]] on the Laser Mech firing twice can eliminate any boss.
** [[Henry Kwan]] and [[Prospero]] allow for better positioning of the Laser Mech.

Does the [[Zoltan Shield]] stack with [[Energy Shield]]? In other words can a unit have both shields on it at the same time?

:No, Mafan's Zoltan Shield does not stack with a regular energy shield. If Mafan already has his Zoltan shield active, attempting to apply a regular shield (with the Pulse Mech or Aegis Mech for e.g.) will simply not work, and the Zoltan Shield will persist.&lt;br&gt;--[[User:CozyPoo|CozyPoo]] ([[User talk:CozyPoo|talk]]) 15:13, 21 September 2022 (UTC)

=== Overlapping information ===

This current page [[Abilities and status effects]] contains information that can already be found under the [[Status Effects]] page. Cleanup is necessary. What would be the preferred approach here? Either a) reanaming this page to just "abilities" and use this one for only that information, merging the other info to the status effects page, or b) discard the Status Effects page and merge all its information into this current page. Or another option I'm not thinking of if anyone else has other suggestions.&lt;br&gt; --[[User:CozyPoo|CozyPoo]] ([[User talk:CozyPoo|talk]]) 15:22, 21 September 2022 (UTC)</text>

=== How does freezing Burrowers work? ===
While adding the tidbit about status effects in the Strategies section, I realized that I don't actually know how burrowers behave when they are frozen. I'm assuming as long as they don't take damage they would stay frozen and not hide. Would be good to add that information if anyone else is more knowledgeable though. --[[User:CozyPoo|CozyPoo]] ([[User talk:CozyPoo|talk]]) 16:01, 13 September 2022 (UTC)</text>

Environments and Tiles seem to be more or less duplicating the same information.  Thoughts on killing one of them?

--[[User:Transce080|Transce080]] ([[User talk:Transce080|talk]]) 00:00, 8 March 2018 (UTC)

I think we can differentiate tiles from environment with tiles being ground, mountain, forest, water, ice, ACID tile, buildings, sand, etc. and environment being ACID pools, mines, smoke, etc. Environment are added to tiles.

== XP ==

The page states, "One XP is gained for each Vek health point (HP), so a 2 HP Vek is worth 2 XP".  Is that still true for enemies that have more HP than normal from [[Soldier Psion]]s?

Yes. I updated the Pilots and [[Soldier Psion]] pages.

There are two separate pages for the [[Spiderling]] and [[Spiderling Egg|Spiderling Eggs]]. I understand that they have separate actions (mandibles and hatch) with the egg having a smoke immunity, but it seems redundant to separate them when they both go hand in hand; one can't exist without the other. Would it make more sense to merge their information in a single page?

Most of the pages that describe weapons have a section tiering weapons. Since this is a Wiki page for Into the Breach, it should ideally remain as neutral and as informative as possible. I understand that achieving true neutrality is vague and hard to define, specially when providing advice for what is good and what isn't. That said, including a letter to rate the usefulness of a weapon is not informative, since it's not clear what grading scale the author used, and the grade is also biased towards what the author considers "good."

So what I propose is: rename these sections to "Strategy" — much like a handful of pages already have a "Strategy" section — and remove the tier. We can still keep the usage tips, rewriting them where they are not relevant (the Advanced Edition did make some outdated) or to make them more clear, as these are fairly helpful still even if still subjective. This would present less bias from the few authors who wrote them. --[[User:CozyPoo|CozyPoo]] ([[User talk:CozyPoo|talk]]) 14:10, 21 April 2023 (UTC)

:I've removed the tier section from all existing pages as of today, and have been formatting all of the pages to contain more information about weapon upgrades, availability, and more detailed usage tips. There are still a handful of weapon and passive pages that need to be created, but it's come a long way since then. To anyone else reading; don't be shy to contribute! --[[User:CozyPoo|CozyPoo]] ([[User talk:CozyPoo|talk]]) 20:27, 5 January 2024 (UTC)</text>

In the [[Zenith Guard#Strategies|Strategies]] section, there's a tidbit about having Harold or Kaz in the Defense Mech to give it the ability to push which "makes its default Attraction Pulse useless by comparison." The advice to put one of those pilots in that mech is solid, but it's the last "useless" tidbit that I think could be changed: it might be better to remain more neutral and instead write "Harold Schmidt and Kazaakpleth can give the Defense Mech additional utility, with the option to both push and pull targets." Or something like that. Thoughts? --[[User:CozyPoo|CozyPoo]] ([[User talk:CozyPoo|talk]]) 14:35, 13 September 2022 (UTC)</text>

|
|Ralph Karlsson [Unknown] Ralph has crossed the breach almost more times he can count - there's been at least a hundred timelines he's watched fall (in the opening state, he has yet to save even one). This continuous cycle of warfare has made him ruthlessly efficient, being unwilling to even sleep if he has to, as he feels every second counts... and every second that slips away could be the critical moment lost to the Vek. He's come a long way from the wide-eyed soldier he first was (it seems like several lifetimes ago, and it was), and he tries to avoid attachments to the other pilots, as he knows how likely they are to die in battle. He has never said which island he hails from, and there are suspicions he may have come from somewhere beyond the Corporate archipelago... possibly even from a space station. If true, Ralph has refused to confirm it, although in a few timelines, both Bethany, Harold, and Isaac have commented on the Time Pod's architecture as being modeled off of space-faring tech (notably a launch capsule of a rocket... or an escape pod of a rocket).
|Bethany Jones [Pinnacle] Bethany Jones served as a physics engineer at Pinnacle, helping design and refine Pinnacle shield technology. Having only grown up on Pinnacle, she's somewhat sheltered with regards to the other islands, and she tends to trusting of others, taking them at their word. She loves the cold and the snow, but she's also excited by the opportunities to see other islands in the Corporate archipelago and learn from the people there. While she and Isaac are technically brother and sister, there hasn't been a timeline where they both were alive to realize this (either Bethany dies at a young age, or Isaac dies - only one of them could be saved in the womb b/c of a chronic medical condition their parents had). Bethany has had a more positive upbringing than Isaac, and her genius is tempered more with empathy and optimism than Isaac (who had a much more difficult childhood).
|Abe Isamu [R.S.T.] Sometimes jokingly called "Honest Abe" in previous timelines, nothing could be farther from the truth. Abe served as an "expeditor" (assassin and "black box" work) during the early years of CEO Kern's rise to power, and he took on many names and identities in service to R.S.T. to handle any "difficult issues" that would arise that needed to be dealt with by the corporation. He is ruthless when given an objective (in this case, fighting the Vek), and served as ground support in his original timeline before stealing a Mech from a dying (?) pilot and using its breach technology to escape the timeline after the squad perished in the volcanic island. Since then, "Abe" has followed the orders of his first CEO Kern and is determined to keep fighting until every Vek in every timeline is defeated... a hopeless task, but "Abe" realizes he has little else to fight for, and even if he were to remain in a timeline he saved, he could not deal with the idea that other timelines were still in jeopardy. He has yet to encounter his duplicate, and if so, he may not recognize them due to surgery and the fluctuation of identities his job required before the Vek attack.
|Harold Schmidt [Archive] Harold is as close as they come to an engineering "sociopath" (this is not the clinical term - co-workers in previous timelines used to call him a "technopath," but even that's not an accurate term for his lack of empathy and social skills). He finds humans uncomfortable and confusing, and takes solace in tinkering with robotics and machines who have clear rulesets and reasons for what they do. In his original timeline, he served a brief term at Detritus (where he seemed bored and uncommunicative), then was rejected from Pinnacle due to his psychological exam, then found a home in Archive, studying and doing restoration work on Old Earth robotics. He initially applied to Archive's open-call for pilot training so it could get him closer to the Mech technology, then it was discovered he did well on the pilot exam (better than most Archive volunteers), and he agreed to serve as a soldier as a way of giving him access to the cutting edge of Mech technology. (Note that Harold doesn't bear any ill-will toward Detritus and Pinnacle, nor do they bear him any ill-will... however, both Singh's predecessor and Zenith saw Harold's lack of empathy, and were worried it could lead to accidents or disregard for human life while he was carrying out his duties.)
|Prospero [Detritus] In its original timeline, Prospero was a recycler robot from Detritus. Its job was to monitor region safety in Detritus disposal sites, but was severely damaged in a disposal accident (this was in the days before Vikram was CEO). The "recycled recycler" robot was sold at a discount to Archive as a groundskeeper for some of the nature preserves, and it seemed to take to the work, translating its knowledge of chemistry and recycling technology to help cultivate gardens (and when it wasn't able to do this, it would devour all books on botany, biology, and even spiritual books related to nurturing and growing of all life forms). It would have likely have remained a quiet hulking gardener were it not for the emergence of the Vek. When the Vek erupted on Archive, the robot followed its directives to protect the nature preserves… and saw the Vek as nothing more than garden pests to be eliminated to protect the plants. When Archive was able to send reinforcements to the region, they found Prospero still quietly tending its garden, now fertilized with Vek corpses. 
Much like Gana, Prospero is viewed with some suspicion due to the robot uprising, but like Gana, Prospero follows orders and has proven itself on many occasions. When traversing to a new timeline, Prospero seems to actively avoid returning to Detritus. The reason for this is unknown.
|Lily Reed [Archive] Lily was an orphan found at sea at the age of seven (she's now 20), then found and raised by Archive when her makeshift life raft came in sight of their island. Lily was only newly-employed at Archive before she answered the open call for pilot training - some employees may have frowned at her sudden shift in career were it not for the urgency to find soldiers to fight the Vek. Unlike others at Archive who wished to slowly tinker with the Mechs, she embraced her training whole-heartedly, soon learning to use the Mech with one of the fastest training times of any Archive pilot on record. Lily's gone through only a few timelines (or maybe just one) and even seeing the end of the world hasn't dulled her enthusiasm for stopping the Vek. She is a talented pilot and engineer, and her near-hyperactive energy has found a good outlet on the battlefield.
|Chen Rong [Detritus] Chen is Henry Kwan's opposite. He's dutiful, conscientious, and puts other's safety before his own. Chen was a high-level manager of one of the key Teleportation Waste Sites in Detritus (much like a central hub to distribute waste to the proper sections of the island), and was responsible for transporting and managing hundreds of disposal lines at once (much like an air traffic controller in the old days, but this was governing the movement of waste, junk, and insuring there were no back-ups or stoppages in the supply line). It is believed this gave him considerable skill in tactics that was recognized during the open call for pilots when the Vek first attacked. Unlike Kwan, Rong didn't volunteer because he wanted to fight, or rise above his position, he did it because he believed it was his responsibility. Since then, he has proven a capable and reliable solider, although he lacks Kwan's battle instincts.
|Henry Kwan [Detritus] Henry Kwan is perhaps the least reliable and least safety-minded worker in Detritus. It seemed he would be forever regulated to a low-level A.C.I.D. report-filing bureau at Detritus - until the Vek attacked. Impulsively, he applied for the open call for pilot training, and he passed the aptitude test with flying colors (his instincts and reflexes seemed to shine in "think-fast" situations - as well as situations where he could cause a lot of damage... intentionally.). While hardly the most modest employee at Detritus, his accomplishments in battle have only fed his ego. Despite the timelines lost, Henry seems to see it all as some sort of game, and remains distant from the actual suffering - some suspect his jokes and boasting are a psychological shield, and thus, are afraid to pierce it, in case he loses what gives him his fighting confidence in the first place by dwelling on his failures vs. his accomplishments.
|Camila Vera [R.S.T.] Camila is the sixth adopted daughter of Jessica Kern (who maintains an extended family of 20, none of them related by blood) from her Origin Timeline. She is a ex-cartographer and meteorological scout from R.S.T. - she was previously assigned to do field surveys and do "terrain testing" in areas where the corporation were testing out new terraforming weapons (she was essentially terraforming "Q.A."). In this role, she became an excellent pilot (the others are dead, it's an unforgiving job) and developed a "sixth sense" for piloting craft in hazardous conditions and trusting her instincts to "move" whenever she sensed a quake or collapse in the ground was about to occur. She has since channeled this sixth sense into combat, learning to anticipate and evade Vek webs as well as knowing how to pilot her Mech in the thickest dust storms without handicapping her combat efficiency. She was one of the first volunteers to fight the Vek in her original timeline after the death of her adopted mother, and also (she's never revealed this to anyone else) she has always had a loathing for insects, so she takes satisfaction in wiping out the giant varieties (the Vek).
|Gana [Archive] Gana is a construction robot adapted for combat by uploading a mix of old and modern combat routines from the Archive libraries (think Baymax in Big Hero 6). This has had… partial success, and what happened to Gana is evidence as to why he was the only construction robot so outfitted: while an excellent soldier, his expressions and outlook are a blend of construction-focused speech mixed with ruthless pragmatism. As an example, Gana may categorize an otherwise simple repair as "offending parts have been executed" - or he may start ordering a building's infrastructure to "hold the line" to prevent a collapse. Soldiers who have served with Gana for an extended period of time have come to ignore its unusual speech patterns as the robot is incredibly effective on the field (and obeys orders), but Gana can be disconcerting for new pilots. Gana has indicated that when the war with the Vek is over, he would prefer to return to his construction duties, and finds he experiences "reduced job satisfaction" in fighting the Vek. 
Note that given the recent rise in prejudice against the Pinnacle robots, Gana has suffered similar discrimination… and several officers have questioned if Gana's "sanity" in case he may malfunction like the Pinnacle robots.
|Isaac [Pinnacle] Isaac has seen too many timelines collapse, and seen too many permutations for how things can go wrong - his high intelligence actually works against him, rather than makes him more confident because he can imagine all the ways things can go wrong (think Chidi Anagonye in The Good Place). He feels ill-suited for being a soldier (his squad mates usually agree, but his scientific knowledge is indispensable). 
While he and Bethany are technically brother and sister, there hasn't been a timeline where they both were alive to realize this (either Bethany dies at a young age, or Isaac dies - only one of them could be saved in the womb b/c of a chronic medical condition their parents had). He respects machines and sees them as equals due to being raised on Pinnacle (he has faith in Zenith, perhaps too much as he feels she's too intelligent to do anything wrong).
Isaac is as much of a genius as his sister, although self-doubt weakens him. He has considerable knowledge of aeronautics, physics, gravitation theory and manipulation, and a number of other fields. It is likely Isaac could master any science he chose to, his only block is his own perceived limitations.
|Silica [R.S.T.] Silica is a hybrid of Pinnacle and R.S.T. technology, believed to be one of the first (and possibly only) artificial intelligences devoted to terrain architecture. 
In "his" original timeline, Silica was responsible for first detecting and studying the Vek, and eventually was modified to investigate their hives... this nearly ended catastrophically, and Silica was recovered and his programming altered from terraforming to terraforming-based-combat... the concept of using the existing terrain and shaping it, exploiting it, and using the surrounding region as a weapon against the Vek. 
When Silica jumped timelines, his original programming was unknown to every subsequent timeline, and they have seen him only in his role as a environmental tactician, designed to help the islands defeat the Vek.
|Archimedes [Pinnacle] Archimedes is a cutting-edge robotic intelligence (a Sentient, he finds the term "robot" and "artificial" to be discriminatory) from Pinnacle designed to act as a Human Relations officer. It has come from a timeline where Pinnacle "oversaw" the islands (the Pinnacle Island Network: P.I.N.) and tended to the humans' needs (much like how you would take care of animals on a farm, but not in a mean or ruthless way – the Sentients simply saw themselves as benevolent caretakers to keep the humans from hurting themselves). 
Zenith has refused to allow Archimedes access to her network, for fear that his directives may corrupt programming on Pinnacle (if this occurred it would be inadvertent, but it is a possibility). Archimedes believes the rioting behavior of the robots on Pinnacle is due to either (1) a contradictory directive they are attempting to follow or reconcile, or (2) the possibility that the arrival of sentient pilot variants from other timelines may indeed be interfering with the natural programmatic order on the island.
|The Mantis are an alien race from the game FTL. Generic text is used to streamline these pilots for use in the game. Kazaaakpleth is a secret pilot that can be gained over the course of the game.
General Background: The Mantis exist to expand, loot, and plunder. There are males and females of the species. They once enslaved the Engi (and thus, may have an overseer-like dominance toward their Mech). They are expansionist, tribal, warlike, and polytheistic. Females often don't make it to high positions of authority unless they are particularly vicious.
The Mantis at key points in their life, have to either return home to reform their exoskeletons (non-biological materials adhere to a resin secreted by their epidermal layers) - or to a suitable planet with the same materials. The Earth of Into the Breach is one such planet although it's not clear if the Mantis were aware of that. Their ships are also composed of the same crust as the Mantis "wear." Presumably this crust can be applied to Mech hulls as well (not planning to discuss/show in game, merely commenting this). Mantis ship hulls may also be bedecked with hides, corpses, and remains of their kills. The Mantis enjoy teleporter technology in hunting prey (teleporting onto ships) and are comfortable with the technology (but the Breach tech may be more primitive than they're used to).
Specific Background: Kazaaakpleth is feared among his own people because he doesn't hunt aliens... he prefers to hunt his own kind. He outwardly claims to be doing this for bounties and for a higher, noble purpose, but secretly, he enjoys killing other Mantis. His craft is an escape pod from a failed encounter with a tribe of his own people he'd marked for death. His craft detected the beacon from Earth, and followed it to the corporate islands. He soon relalized he'd come to the "Happy Hunting Grounds" a place where he can practice his fighting skills on larger varities of insects than ever (the Vek) and a machine (his Mech) that he can use as a weapon. Kazaaakpleth is happy to slay as many Vek as he can, although if he had the skill to build a ship and take to the stars with the technology he has found, he would do so. Like Mantis, do, K. needs to reestablish his carapace, and he finds the islands rich with suitable biological material - including Vek corpses.
|The Zoltan are an alien race from the game FTL. Generic text is used to streamline these pilots for use in the game. Mafan is a secret pilot that can be gained over the course of the game.
General Background: The Zoltan are a wise, intelligent species of energy, about to transcend to a higher "level" – of consciousness. They favor enlightenment above all else. They are respectful, tactful, and humble… but not pushovers if attacked. Younger members ("children") in the lore are said to be gaining telepathic powers. 
Specific Background: Mafan was on a pilgrimage when the beacon summoned it. It finds the idea of the breaches to be akin to enlightenment along the lines of Groundhog Day although it finds them surprising… it considers the two week "recycling" of the self an opportunity to reflect on one's actions forever within an enclosed temporal loop. It considers the Vek to be an obstruction to this enlightenment, but also a necessary part of the phenomenon that keeps sparking the breaches to be made. (More specifics about the tone and intent of each of the lines below can be found in the Writing Style Guide, broken down line by line, if curious – it gives more information on how Mafan and the Zoltan might perceive certain events.)
|The Rock (People) are an alien race from the game FTL. Generic text is used to streamline these pilots for use in the game. Ariadne is a secret pilot that can be gained over the course of the game.
General Background: Rock (people, male and females of the species exist) are large, herbivorous bipeds. Rock(men) are natural isolationists and like to be left alone. They are dogmatic and single-minded. In their own territories, they are largely religious zealots and have a wide interpretation of cultural transgression (ex: offers to trade can be interpreted as hostile). Rock(men) are raised so that radical members of their species are separated from the population and carefully managed so that they can fit in with the rest of their culture. Interaction with alien species is illegal. Their home culture involve arranged marriages. They were one of the founders of the Federation (along with humans and Engi). 
Rockmen who do not conform to their species stereotype (say, rebelling against religion or by being simply... different) can be found amongst the stars, and several instances of Rock pirates and warriors exist in the Big Black (they are known to cover their ships with "outcast decorations"). 
Specific Background: Ariadne (female of the species) was fleeing a pre-arranged marriage to a Basilisk Chief (see FTL) when the beacon diverted her vessel. Her crime prevents her from wanting to return to Rock space even if she could... but is uncomfortable amongst the many cultures on the new planet she has found. She is vaguely curious what time travel/breach technology could possibly do to erase her crime and the events leading up to it, allowing for a fresh start.

|Personality
|Character guidelines for chatter
|Artificial pilots are assigned to mechs as a last resort in combat. While they are capable of fighting, Mechs excel and become better when manned by a human pilot (or Pinnacle A.I., which are far more advanced). Artificial pilots are often present in the corporate islands, but not accorded the same status nor have the same extent of personality that the Pinnacle robots do.
|These fellows are a little uncertain, but interested in the Mechs they are commanding from an Archive point of view.
|R.S.T. pilots are no-nonsense and share much of Kerns' aggressive pragmatism. They tend to be harsher than the other Island pilots and have a ruthless streak. Sometimes stiff and military ("commander"), but at other times, their eagerness at killing Vek comes out.
|Pinnacle are all A.I.s/Sentients, just to reinforce the robotic theme (even though there are humans on the island).
|Detritus pilots are cautious, careful (both due to their profession), and polite - they, like their CEO, believe in safety first and "disposing" of hazardous material (including Vek) safely vs. swiftly. They are more matter-of-fact and focus on metrics and results. "Haste makes waste" is a good Old Earth expression for explaining their slow, methodical approach.
|
|Classic cold knowledgeable veteran type. No time for those who can't keep up. Cynical/realistic about your chances. Not a very exaggerated character.
|Caring, intelligent, pragmatic. A bit naive to war. Constantly hopeful &amp; encouraging. Looks for the best in humanity.
|Stoic, calculating, cold. Soft spoken.
|Inquisitive; Focused on learning more than just fighting. Easily distracted. Somewhat disinterested and uncaring. Not very empathic.
|Prospero has been repurposed to operate its Mech in harsh conditions. Its English is fine but isn't in love with the new "work" conditions.
|Really excited. Hopeful and a little silly. Feels invulnerable. Sees it as a game.
|Chen is conscientious, reliable, and tries to be a model soldier. He's one of the best examples of managerial skill and leadership at Detritus, and it comes through in fighting the Vek.
|Cocky. Feels he is the hero. Feels invulnerable. Feels he couldn't possibly be wrong.
|Prototypical good soldier. Treats the battle like a military war. Doesn't have time for nonsense. Wishes others were as professional. While she shares traits with Chen Rong, they occasionally (quietly) clash on military issues (she's more hands-on in the fighting, while Rong's more of a supervising officer).
|Construction robot adapted for military use. Meant to interface with people so speaks in sentences but is very curt and unemotional.
|Paranoid &amp; pessimistic. Generally a good person but not handling all the stress well, and his attitude can sometimes be demoralizing - he's suspicious of his own successes and victories. Definitely a "this timeline's already half-lost" kind of guy. Stutters because of temporal research studies... it's caused a nervous system problem in his speech patterns.
|A relatively calm, pragmatic machine who has adjusted to the change in its original purpose of mineral survey to destruction. It tends to quantify its responses in terms of how actions will affect the environment first, then the individuals second.
|Well-mannered, aristocratic, superior (he comes from a more advanced timeline, he believes), and can be condescending toward humans.
|Mantis speak in a kind of chittering - (i.e. names having a lot of k's or tch's kinda sounds).
|Zoltan are energy beings… so perhaps a wispy ethereal speak.
|Rock people "speech" is like a low grumble - slower, almost a 'rocks grinding' sound.

|"Time to save the world again!",
"I saved the world once, I can do it again.",
"I hope the other Pilots got to their own timelines safely...",
|"The future repeats. And if so, victory is assured."

"I do hope I get to meet Dr. Renfield in this timeline and say what a success his bomb was in the last timeline!",
"I hope this timeline found a way to mount a Renfield bomb on a missile and save us from having to do volcano island duty."

"The remains of the Vek shall once again enrich the soul with their nutrients.",

"Islands, hello - this is #self_full, and I've got good news - the Vek can be beaten, and I'll show you how!"
|"Can't let the last victory get to my head. We could lose it all again in a heartbeat.",
"Let's see if what I learned beating the Vek last time can be used to help these islands as well."
|"Time to save the world again! This time with a little more style than the LAST timeline, that's for sure.",
"Still riding high from defeating the Vek... I wish everyone in this timeline had seen me pull that off!",

"Commander... it's... it's good to hear your voice again. I am Officer #self_full, and I come from a timeline where we beat the Vek. I can show you how."
|"Islands, this is #self_reverse. I have repaired a previous timeline's Vek damage. I will now do the same to yours.",
"Islands, this is #self_reverse. I am from a timeline where the Vek population was violently extracted. I will now do the same to yours.",
"Islands, this is #self_reverse. I have saved a similar timeline from the Vek. Together, we will expunge the Vek from this one as well.",
"I am #self_reverse. I have come to this timeline to forcibly eradicate your Vek hives. Please send your leader to me for further instructions.",

|Island_Perfect
|Used when the player does not fail a single objective on the island. They get a free reward
|"You accomplished every Archive mission, an astounding accomplishment! Please, you and the #squad accept this as thanks.",
|"You completed every mission on R.S.T. despite the odds. You've earned my respect, #squad - and everything we can offer.",
|"You have saved Pinnacle, accomplishing every objective without fail. Allow me to provide additional aid.",
|"#squad, it my pleasure to inform you your success rate is 100%. Detritus corporate bylaws dictate you've earned a bonus.", 
"Detritus has an aggressive bonus plan for excellence in performance, commander. You and your #squad deserve it.", 
"Due to your efforts, commander, our success to failure ratio has reversed since your arrival. Permit Detritus to share the fruits of that success with you.",
|-
|
|Welcome_Message
|Used upon arrival to the island.
|"The bad news is the Vek are overrunning our island, putting refugees and historical artifacts at risk. The good news is we have Old Earth military artifacts that can help in the fight!",
"We're doing all we can to protect the refugees, but we need your help against the Vek. We'll assist with some of our Old Earth artifacts if we can.",
"If you are from the future, you'll find our island is even further back in time than you expected. If not for the Vek, I'd have loved to give you a tour of the Old Earth relics.",
"You've shown up in the nick of time! The Vek are overrunning our island archive. The Old Earth relics here still have some fight in them, they could help us.",
"Civilizations of the past had a military strength vastly exceeding ours. Good thing we preserved some of their old war machines!",
|"My advisors insist we're losing the fight. They also insist I trust you. And since those cowards rarely insist I do anything, I'm giving you a chance to prove yourselves.",
"Don't think for a moment I'm falling for the 'time traveler' stories, but your Mechs - they are undeniably impressive.",
"You won't find me as gullible as my department heads. Whatever 'time traveler' nonsense you claim, it's your firepower we need.",
"We can postpone the discussion on where you got this advanced weaponry until after you use it.",
"R.S.T. was divided on asking you for help; it was viewed as weakness. But the choice is stark: we either ally with you or lose the island.",
|"I hope you can respect both forms of life on this island, organic and mechanical.",
"The humans employed at Pinnacle are just as important as the sentient machines. We must stop the Vek to save all life.",
"On behalf of Pinnacle, I welcome you. The climate on our island isn't ideal for humans, but the low temperatures are vital for machine life to thrive.",
|"I have heard of your triumphs against the Vek, commander. We hope you and the #squad can aid us in our fight as well.", 
"Our accommodations are sparse, commander, but you and the #squad are welcome here. To quote our corporate motto, 'Detritus is at your disposal'.",
"Our island was once one of hundreds of Detritus disposal sites. Then the Vek came. But with your arrival, Detritus has hope again.",
"When the Vek came, Detritus took on what refugees we could. What we lack is your military expertise, commander.",

|Mission_ExtremeDamage
|If *any* mission results in extreme structure damage (4+ buildings?), these comments will trigger instead of standard mission comments
|"Rising seas destroyed most of our world, but it seems it's the Vek that will end us. So many lives were lost during this mission - we can't let it happen again!", 
"The structural damage sustained during that battle was costly. We've lost irreplaceable research and priceless artifacts.", 
"If every battle against the Vek results in that much damage, I don't think there'll be much left of Archive to help in the war.",
|"I've seen the casualty reports from your mission. The losses... were considerable. But not unendurable.",
"My staff reports your attacks are hurting us more than the Vek - but keep hammering them, no matter what it takes.",
"I fired my advisors after they objected to the collateral damage on this mission. War means people die - it's that or we lose the planet.", 
"Many died today - too many. But the ends justify the means when you see the end coming for you.",
"The loss of life in the last battle - it is better than losing the planet. We must all make sacrifices.",
"My people understand their sacrifices are not in vain. We must keep the pressure on, or everyone will die.",
|"Hundreds perished in that attack. Each a unique being the world will never see again.",
"We have lost much today, human and machine. We will see if Pinnacle can recover.",
"Other timelines may exist for you, but this is the only one we have. Please fight for us as we would fight for you."
|"We cannot lose so many lives in a single battle, commander. Detritus is not the island, it is not the company - it is our people.",
"Accidents happen - we at Detritus know this all too well - but is there some other approach that will yield better results?",
"Accidents happen, but it reminds us we must do better, especially when lives are at stake - and even more when lives are lost.",
"I've seen the casualty reports and am contacting the surviving families personally.",
"I know you have done much, but I ask you to not let the lives of our people be the cost of defeating the Vek.",
"Detritus is nothing without its people, commander. I urge you and the #squad to put our citizens first.",
"The damage to the region was... extensive. While I've been told my... sentiments could cost us the war, I beg of you - consider our people.",

|Generic Missions
|Mission_Generic_Briefing
|Missions without anything unique happening could pull from the generic pools
|"Technology from the future protecting technology from the past! Has a poetic ring to it, doesn't it? Let's hope the future is up to the task.", 
"Much of Old Earth and its history was lost when the oceans rose. We must protect what little is left. If the Vek destroy us, these artifacts may be all that remains of our civilization.", 
"Refugees living in preserved 21st century cities was not what the Archive founders intended, but we need to shelter everyone as best we can.", 
"There are Technology Vaults buried under this region, we've got to drive the Vek out before they can damage them!", 
"With most of Old Earth under water, we've got to defend what little remains. Archive has protected these buildings for decades, but we're counting on you now.",
|"Our island suffered greatly when we turned our terraforming tech against the Vek. Still, we must defend what's left.",
"The civilians in those buildings are tough, but not invincible. Make sure they survive this fight.",
"Grind the Vek into the dirt they're breeding in. If your story of the future is true, they must be stopped here and now.",
|"I'm simultaneously monitoring 84 subterranean micro-incursions by the Vek. You will have to manage this one on your own.",
"Three out of five subroutines are giving you a low chance of success on this mission. Please be careful.",
"With the island melting and sentient life driven mad, you and your Mechs are their only chance.", 
"Our residential buildings are full of both forms of sentient life. The survival of two species is depending on you.",
|"You must press on, commander. Detritus will do all we can to assist you here.",
"Do as you must, commander - the Vek must be driven back and our people protected.",
"Know that you and the #squad are our wall against the Vek, commander. We put our faith in you",
"I have faith in you and the #squad, commander. Know that all of Detritus stands with you.",
|-

|Mission_Generic_Success
|Missions that pull from the generic objectives have a small chance of using this set
|"There's a lot of unused space in this region's nature preserves. We'll begin moving refugees here now the Vek are gone.", 
"Vek are not easily defeated, yet you put them down with flying colors. My compliments to the pilots.", 
"The troops of Old Earth would have been proud! If only they had been here to see it...", 
"With this region secured, we can open our Technology Vaults. Let's see what other Old Earth tech we can use against the Vek!",
|"That's the spirit we need if we're going to win this fight. Good work, both you and your... '#squad'.",
"Excellent, you've gained ground - we'll hold it now, you and your squad keep advancing.",
"Never thought we'd dig the Vek out - wherever you're from, I hope there's more of you on the way.",
"I read the casualty reports, and it's my pleasure to report the Vek are in the top percentile.",
"Region is secure. Deploying troops to hold the area before the weather shifts.",
|"You and the #squad have driven back the Vek. We are updating our chances of success based on this battle.",
"Additional victories of this kind will increase our chances of survival considerably.",
"Excellent news: My prognosticator sub-process has dramatically increased the odds of our survival based on your victory.",
|"Well done, #squad! Good news is rare these days, but your efforts here have changed that.",
"You've driven them back, commander! This has bought us more time to bolster Detritus' defenses.",
"I know my thanks is a poor reward, but all of Detritus is grateful for what you and the #squad have done here today.",
"My faith in you was not misplaced, commander. You have Detritus' gratitude.",
"With the success of the #squad on the field, I've been able to focus efforts on the factories and the Vek elsewhere on Detritus!",
|-
|
|Mission_Generic_Failure
|Are we going to use these? They aren't currently used
|"Well now, hmmm... that could have gone better for everyone involved. Let's hope the next battle is more successful.",
"Without your help, humanity will join Old Earth and be a thing of the past. But we can't let this mission be the norm, we have to do better!",
|"I don't care about your best - don't let the enemy gain any more ground. I shouldn't need to tell you this!",
"We don't have anywhere to retreat. If you think we can run, you're wrong. This is all we have.",
"Your best isn't good enough. We need better.",
"If you can't use your weapons to win this fight, then surrender them to someone who can.",
|"At least you were able to save some sentient life in the region, though you failed to accomplish anything else.",
"Our objectives were not met. Recalculating our chances of mounting a successful defense.",
|"I am grateful for your efforts, commander... even if the results were not what we hoped.",
"Today has been a victory for the Vek. I fear if we lose any more ground, Detritus and our people may be lost.",
|-
|
|Mission_Mechs_Dead
|Not currently used, but we'll need it
|"My condolences for the loss of your pilots... they fought bravely and well. They will be remembered.",
"Know that all Archive Corporation mourns the loss of your pilots. We know you are putting yourselves in harm's way for us.",
|"The war won't be determined by this battle - but a few more like this, and it might be. We can't afford any more losses.",
"One lost battle doesn't lose the war - but we can't continue to lose ground. You need to focus.",
|"Your pilots are the heart of your war machine. Without them you don't stand a chance."
|"I have asked that the names of your fallen pilots be added to our Memorial Wall. Their sacrifice will not be forgotten.",
"The Mechs of the #squad are powerful, but I worry few are left to pilot them - now, even fewer than before.",

|Generic Objectives
|
|Some missions use generic objectives, so the CEO can pull from these lists to address those objectives
|
|
|
|
|-
|
|Mission_MechHealth_Briefing
|This bonus objective is for limiting damage to the Mechs themselves.
|"Our equipment and resources to repair your Mechs are limited - please keep damage to a minimum if you can.",
|"We can barely keep our cities functioning, let alone repair your Mechs if they are damaged. Choose your shots carefully.",
"This isn't Pinnacle - we don't have enough engineering crews to fix your Mechs if they take heavy damage.",
|"There will be little time between skirmishes and we need you fully operational. Exercise caution.",
"Our robotic repair teams are offline. It will be difficult to assist with Mech repair before the next combat operation. Please keep that in mind.",
|"Unfortunately, most of our engineering division is occupied. If the Mechs of the #squad take too much damage, we may not be able to repair them.",
"We have no personnel to repair your Mechs if damaged. It is unfortunate, but please, do what you can to keep them out of harm's way.",
|-
|
|Mission_MechHealth_Success
|&lt; 4 damage to mechs
|"Your Mechs look almost untouched! That's a relief... it'll allow us to assign our repair crews to reinforce the refugee shelters instead.",
"Your Mechs are barely scratched! That'll allow us to assign our repair crews to emergencies in other regions.",
|"I see you and the #squad weathered the worst of it and survived. Excellent.",
"The repair teams report barely a scratch on your Mechs - efficiently done. We can re-allocate the damage control teams to civilian relief and city protection.",
"Your Mechs took almost no damage. That means we can allocate additional resources and repair crews to help refugee centers elsewhere on R.S.T.",
|"Your ability to defeat the Vek with minimal damage to the Mechs is admirable. If only all humans showed such concern for their machine counterparts.",
|"Success - and only minor damage to your Mechs, commander, well within the projections of what Detritus can repair.",
"Your Mechs have taken only minor damage, my engineers are certain they can get the #squad back into the field quickly.",
|-
|
|Mission_MechHealth_Failure
|&gt;= 4 damage to mechs
|"I'm told we'll need to divert three teams of engineers to repair your Mechs. The engineering teams have more than enough on their plates already...",
|"Your Mechs are heavily damaged; several teams of engineers have been reassigned to repairing them as we speak, even the teams devoted to civilian defense.",
"The damage to your Mechs is extensive - we'll have to call in repair crews from the city centers if we're going to stay in the fight. And we must stay in the fight.",
"Your Mechs are so torn up they're ready for the scrapyard. It'll take our repair crews working double shifts to get them back in fighting shape!",
"We've had to call back engineers from the refugee centers to fix the damage to your '#squad'. Don't let this happen again.",
|"Do not allow your Mech's reinforced hull lead to complacency. Repairing its exoskeleton is a material-heavy process with considerable cost.",
"It seems you are quick to risk your Mechs and their pilots. Both are needed in the war ahead. Please be more careful.",
|"I've had no choice but to assign all emergency engineering divisions to repair your Mechs. This will compromise Detritus' defense efforts severely.",
"Our repair teams report - ah, I quote... 'there's more shredded metal than Mech' and conclude with an... unoptimistic... report of the chances of repair.",
"Our pilots report the #squad are so damaged they barely fit into the docking bays. We'll need to assign additional personnel for repairs.",

|
|Mission_GridHealth_Briefing
|Bonus objective for keeping power grid damage to a minimum

"I was overseeing maintenance on this Old Earth locomotive myself. Good thing, too - when the Vek struck, ol' Horace became the backbone of our supply lines!", 
"Diesel trains may be old-fashioned by today's standards, but ol' 'Horace' here is going strong - he's vital to our supply lines!",
|"This maglev track is one of our last remaining supply lines. My people rely on it for supplies - without it...",
"This maglev line is a major artery between our remaining cities. We lose it, we lose the cities as well.",
"The maglev runs on solar power - we need to get it out of the approaching stormfront before its cells die.",
"Make sure the supply train reaches the extraction point - we can take it from there.",
"This maglev is one of the few we have left. It needs to get through, or my people will be cut off.",
|
|"Detritus waste disposal relies on trains to ferry hazardous byproducts to our disposal sites... but not if the Vek intercept the trains.",
"Our trains seem to provoke the Vek - whether it's the chemicals or the vibration, we don't know, but the Vek attack them on sight.",
"A waste disposal train is passing through this sector. The vibrations attract the Vek, so we need to protect it from attack.",

"Excellent, the train made it through. We live to fight another day.",

|"Another irreplaceable artifact lost to the Vek. Maybe R.S.T. will sell us one of their maglevs.", 
"That was the last diesel train that doesn't lie at the bottom of an ocean. Unfortunate. We'll need a new way to transport supplies now.",
|"That was one of the last maglevs we had. I'll report the loss to the destination city and see what I can do for the relief efforts there.",
"Every maglev we lose, we lose two cities. Protecting my people means protecting the supply lines.",

"These Old Earth trains were built to last! Despite the knocking it took, we can still get it back up and running - remarkable!", 
"It'll take more than the Vek to stop ol' 'Horace'. We'll have him back on his feet in no time!",
|"Why was the train's path interrupted? It could have been destroyed... my engineers say it's recoverable, but we can't afford to have it idle for repairs.",
"We're dispatching teams to the train now - their priority is to get it running.",

|Mission_Volatile_Briefing
|This mission involves a special monster that explodes when killed. The primary objective is to not kill it, letting it run away.
|"These 'volatile' Vek don't have the courtesy to simply die - they explode and damage entire regions. Drive it away, but whatever you do, don't kill it!", 
"These 'volatile' Vek detonate on death! Drive it away and for safety's sake, don't let it explode!",
|"Normally I wouldn't ask you to hold your fire - but one of the Vek is a Volatile, it'll explode if you kill it. Drive it off instead.",
"A Volatile Vek has been spotted. When they die, they explode and kick up a mile of dust that scrambles our sensors for days - don't kill it, drive it away instead.",
"These Vek are nasty ones. Volatile Vek don't die quietly, they detonate... and take entire districts with them. Do not kill it - make it run.",
"These Volatile Vek are living bombs. Don't kill it, drive it away before it turns the region into a crater.",
|"My Vek Analysis Process has triggered an alert. One of the Vek in this region will detonate on death. You must drive it away without killing it.",
|"We have detected a Volatile Vek in this sector, and it is imperative it not... detonate, or it may cause a chain reaction.",
"Intercept the Vek in this sector, but do not harm the Volatile Vek - drive it away without killing it or the damage will be catastrophic.",

|Volatile Monster survives...
|"I'm sure that explosive Vek will be back, but at least nothing was damaged. Hmm. We should double the blast proofing on the Vaults before it returns...", 
"If we had the resources, we could capture that volatile monstrosity and study it. At least it's gone now, that's a relief!",
|"Excellent. We should be able to track that Volatile and terrabomb it when it hits an abandoned region.",
"One of these days we'll capture that Volatile and figure out how to turn every Vek into one... then set them off in their own hives.",
|"I'm creating a new subroutine to monitor where that Vek goes. I hope it stays far away.",
|"We're tracking the Volatile now - it should pose no further threat to us. We commend your efforts, commander, efficiently done.",
"The Volatile is retreating to its hive. This is good news - we should be able to track it and detonate it when it reaches the nest.",

|Volatile Monsters dies...
|"There was a nature reserve within that Vek's blast radius. One of the last remaining ferret species is likely extinct now.",

|Mission_Lightning_Briefing
|Another "generic" mission, but this one has lightning striking the ground every turn. Weather Control systems out of control?
|
|"One of our meteorological stations has reported Vek converging on their location. Intercept them - but beware the weather, it rains lightning.",
"One of our weather turbines has reported a Vek attack. We can't afford to lose the turbine, but beware the storms in the area - they are out of our control.",
|
|
|-
|
|Mission_Lighting_Success
|"Generic" success as it can also involve a lot of bonus objectives.
|
|"Well done. R.S.T. weather conditions are notoriously difficult to control, but they're one of our best weapons against the Vek."
|

|
|Mission_Terraform_Briefing
|Mission expect the player to use the Terraformer to transform grass into sand (as part of RST's "scorched earth" policy). Though Justin is concerned that it's confusing why the player would want to destroy pretty land, as the mission does not make it clear why destroyed grassland makes a strategic difference.
|
|"We need to activate one of our terraformers to destroy a Vek hive beneath the surface.",
"Use the terraformer on the ground in this sector. We can't let the Vek use the stable land mass to breed; the whole region could be lost.",
"Our terraforming technology is one of our best weapons against buried Vek hives.",
"We need to use the terraformer in this region to collapse Vek tunnels beneath the surface.",
|
|
|-
|
|Mission_Terraform_Success
|Terraformer is defended and all grassland is terraformed
|
|"Terraformer is secure - and sensors report no activity from Vek below the surface. The region is ours.",
"Losing our island's greenery in this way is something I can endure if it means it won't be despoiled by the Vek.",
|
|
|-
|
|Mission_Terraform_Failure
|Terraformer is destroyed (and grassland thus failed to be transformed)
|
|"The terraformer was destroyed - and we already have reports of Vek hives in the region. One of our best weapons in the war is gone.",
|
|
|-
|
|Mission_Terraform_Incomplete
|Terraformer survives, but the grassland remains
|
|"You've secured the terraformer, but it's too late to stop the hives - and that means the surrounding regions are now in danger as well.",
|
|
|-
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|-
|
|Mission_Cataclysm_Briefing
|The entire map is falling away, only half the map remains at the end of the battle
|
|"The cataclysmic failure of a terraformer in the region is destroying the land. Try not to fall into the depths."
|
|
|-
|
|Mission_Cataclysm_Success
|Generic success since there are no mission specific objectives
|
|"That chasm should prove too deep for even the Vek. Maybe we should start sinking more of our island..."
|
|
|-

|
|
|
|
|

|-
|
|Mission_Crack_Briefing
|Crack is spreading across the map from one edge to the other.
|
|"The Vek took out this region's ground stabilizer. We're not sure what the result will be... watch your step."
|
|
|-
|
|Mission_Crack_Success
|Generic success since there are no mission specific objectives
|
|"Another day, another piece of our home destroyed. Once these Vek are gone, our terraformers are going to have to work overtime."

|
|
|
|
|
|-
|
|Mission_Filler_Briefing
|An "Earth Mover" is filling in a chasm in the earth. Player must defend it.
|
|"One of our earth movers is filling in a chasm created by malfunctioning stabilizers. Make sure it stays in one piece."
|
|
|-
|
|Mission_Filler_Success
|"Earth Mover" survives and the ground is filled in
|
|"We'll start constructing subterranean defenses on that new land before the Vek can burrow into it."
|
|
|-
|
|Mission_Filler_Failure
|"Earth Mover" dies -- ground still might be filled in, so don't address that.
|
|"Stable land is at a premium on this island - we needed that earth mover to create a foundation for new shelters and roads!"

|
|Mission_Solar_Briefing
|
|
|"We shape the weather patterns over the island so our solar farms can harvest sunlight twelve hours a day. But to do that, the farms need to remain standing."
|
|
|-
|
|Mission_Solar_Success
|
|
|"Those solar farms are essential for maintaining the Grid. It's a miracle you kept the Vek from destroying them."
|
|
|-
|
|Mission_Solar_Partial
|
|
|"Just one solar farm is insufficient. While the island endures rolling blackouts, I'm sure you'll expect your Mechs to get priority treatment."
|

|-
|
|Mission_Solar_Failure
|

|Mission_Bomb_Briefing
|Two prototype Renfield Bombs are on the map to be defended.
|
|"This site holds two warheads designed by a temporal physicist, Dr. Renfield, utilizing your 'breach' technology. R.S.T. was deemed the safest place to test them."
|
|

|Both bombs defended
|
|"Excellent, both prototypes survived intact. I can order Renfield and his team to move on to stage two."

|Pinnacle Inc Missions
|Mission_FreezeBots_Briefing
|Player is given a tank capable of freezing units in ice for this mission. They are tasked to Freeze 2 Hostile Robots that are present, and make sure they survive (frozen) till the end.

|1 bot was killed for any reason

|Mission_Factory_Briefing
|Two Robotic Factories are spawning hostile robots throughout the mission, but the player must defend the factories -- Robots are fair game, though for lore reasons probably still discouraged
The factories are 'too valuable' to lose and perhaps contain 'innocent sentient lives'?
|
|
|"These factories are manufacturing hostile machines, but there are hundreds of innocent lives within. Please defend them while we try to shut them down safely.",
|
|-

|
|

|
|Mission_Reactivation_Briefing
|"Reactivation" is a misnomer at this point. Field of battle is full of enemy units incased in ice, every turn more units come out of the ice. No special objective, just a straight battle.
|
|
|"When I lost control of my environmental processes, hundreds of Vek and machines alike were frozen solid. As the island comes back online, these fresh dangers are being freed.",

|
|Mission_SnowBattle_Briefing
|Generic battle, but the map has 2 hostile robots on it to start. No special objectives.
Comments like "it's too bad you'll have to kill these bots" would be appropriate.

|
|
|
|
|-
|
|Mission_Stasis_Briefing
|Generic battle, but the map has 2 FROZEN abnormally dangerous robots on it. Player should be encouraged to avoid freeing the robots, though they are not penalized so it shouldn't sound like an objective.
|
|
|"Threat Diagnostic: &lt;Machines: Frozen. Threat: Very high.&gt; I recommend you avoid them."

|Every building is frozen in ice at mission start. Player is tasked to free at least 5 buildings from the ice.
|
|
|"One of my environmental processes crashed, and the result was an entire city encased in ice. The lives within are still functioning - but they will die if not freed in time.",

|
|
|"There should be no lasting damage to the occupants. And my environmental monitor is functioning normally again.",

|Mission_SnowStorm_Briefing
|Generic mission. Snow Storm will periodically freeze large sections of the map in ice during the mission.
|

|"The local coolant station detonated, releasing storms of cryo-nanites into the atmosphere. Avoid them or your Mechs may be flash-frozen.",

|Detritus Missions
|Mission_Barrels_Briefing
|Large Vats of A.C.I.D. need to be destroyed. (Unstable? Create traps for Vek? Any reason really)
|
|
|
|"A Vek hive lies directly beneath the waste disposal tanks in this region. Detonate the vats, and the chemical runoff will destroy the hive.",
"The vats in this region contain chemicals poisonous to the Vek - breach the containment vats, and the Vek will vacate the sector.",
|-
|
|Mission_Barrels_Failure
|Not enough vats destroyed
|
|
|
|"Unfortunately, not enough chemicals were seeded into the ground - the Vek still remain in the sector.",
"While the Vek advance was slowed, not enough vats were destroyed to halt them. Unfortunate, but there is nothing more to be done.",
|-
|
|Mission_Barrels_Success
|All vats destroyed
|
|
|
|"100% of the vats were destroyed and the chemicals released. Our sensors are already picking up diminished Vek activity in the region.",
|-
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|-
|
|Mission_Disposal_Briefing
|Play uses Disposal Unit (needs a name) -- It launches a A.C.I.D. projectile that immediately desolves a large area. The player must use it to melt all mountains on the map. (For the resources? Because Vek are in them?)
|
|
|
|"Vek hives infest the mountains in this sector. An A.C.I.D. Launcher is stationed in the region - defend it while it disassembles the mountain range.",
"We need the #squad to defend this A.C.I.D. Launcher while it dissolves the Vek hives infesting the mountains.",
|-
|
|Mission_Disposal_Failure
|Disposal unit destroyed + Mountains remain
|
|
|
|"Disappointing - the Launcher and its crew are lost, and the mountains and the Vek hives remain. We'll need to abandon the sector.",
"The A.C.I.D. Launcher was destroyed, along with its crew. I will inform the families personally, and order the sector quarantined at once.",
|-
|
|Mission_Disposal_Mountains
|Mountains remain
|
|
|
|"The Vek hives remain. Sensors report they are spawning new Vek. We'll have to abandon the sector before they overrun us.", 
"The Launcher is still active, but the hives in the mountains remain. Sensors report the Vek swarming the area - we have to pull back.",
|-
|
|Mission_Disposal_Disposal
|Disposal Unit dead
|
|
|
|"The A.C.I.D. Launcher was destroyed along with its crew - yet their sacrifice was not in vain. The Vek hives have been eradicated."
|-
|
|Mission_Disposal_Success
|Disposal Unit Survives, Mountains destroyed
|
|
|
|"Your mission was a success, commander - the A.C.I.D. Launcher is intact and the Vek disintegrated.",
|-
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|-
|
|Mission_AcidTank_Briefing
|Player controls an A.C.I.D. tank (needs name?) for the mission. It applies A.C.I.D. to units. Mission is to destroy Vek that have the A.C.I.D. applied (so the A.C.I.D. has a chance to recycle the corpses?)
|
|
|
|"Detritus has assigned an A.C.I.D. tank in this sector to the #squad - use it to study the A.C.I.D.'s effects on the Vek.",
"An A.C.I.D. tank has been deployed to this sector. Take out any Vek hit by the tank, then secure the sector so we can study the Vek remains.",
|-
|
|Mission_AcidTank_Failure
|Not enough units with acid killed
|
|
|
|"Too many Vek escaped the A.C.I.D. test - we don't have enough Vek remains to conduct proper analysis."
|-
|
|Mission_AcidTank_Success
|4 Vek with Acid killed
|
|
|
|"A success, commander – with your help, a sufficient number of Vek were inflicted with A.C.I.D. for study.",
|-
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|-
|
|Mission_Acid_Briefing
|Normal battle, but Vek are jumping out of the ACID pools to attack. They have ACID pre-applied to them as a game effect. (They're adapting? They can live surprisingly long with it?)
|
|
|
|"These A.C.I.D. pools are being hit by the Vek, but the Vek seem to be... adapting to the chemicals. We need to stop the Vek before they develop an immunity.",
"This sector has several A.C.I.D. storage lakes. The Vek seem to be using them as routes to reach the surface.",
|-

|"#squad, you are to be commended - sensors confirm the Vek have been driven back. The sector is once again ours.",

|
|Mission_Power_Briefing
|Power plants need to be defended (two on the map)
|
|
|
|"This sector has two Grid installations that power many of our Detritus' factories. These installations are vital to Detritus' defense efforts.",
"The power plants in this sector are critical against the Vek, commander. If lost, we may lose Detritus as well.",
|-
|
|Mission_Power_Success
|Power plants both alive
|
|
|
|"Both power plants have reported in, and there's been no disruption in the Grid. You and your pilots have our gratitude, commander.",
|-
|
|Mission_Power_Partial
|One Power Plant destroyed
|
|
|
|"One of the plants was lost. We'll have to initiate energy rationing for all but the most critical facilities, but Detritus may be able to recover.",
|-
|
|Mission_Power_Failure
|Both Power Plants destroyed
|
|
|
|"The loss of both plants has not only caused our factories to go dark, but several refugee centers as well. I'll need to relocate the people immediately.",
|-
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|-
|
|Mission_Belt_Briefing
|Normal battle, but the map has massive conveyor belts that push the units around. (Normally used for transporting waste and recycling? Used for transportation of civilians?)
|
|
|
|"Normally we use Conveyer Yards to ferry waste vats - but you and the #squad may be able to use the conveyers against the Vek.",
|-
|
|Mission_Belt_Success
|(Generic success)
|
|
|
|The Conveyor Yard is secured. Thank you, commander - we had not thought to use the conveyer belts in a military capacity.",
|-
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|-
|
|Mission_Teleporter_Briefing
|Normal battle, but the map has teleporter spaces that can warp units between different spaces on the map. (Again, why? Transport of waste/people/tech/etc?)
|
|
|
|"This is one of our teleporter sites - it transports waste by disassembling and reassembling matter. You may be able to use the teleporters against the Vek.", 
"While teleporting biomatter is prohibited by the Corporate Accords, I can make an exception for you - and the Vek.",
"Disposal teleporters are active in this sector, built to disassemble and transport waste matter. You could use them to outmaneuver the Vek.",
|-
|
|Mission_Teleporter_Success
|(Generic success)
|
|
|
|"The teleporter site is ours - we will continue to use these teleporters against the Vek if need be.",
"The site is back under our control - and following your example, we can use the teleporters against the Vek if they attack again.",

* Post only issues that ''require'' administrative action, i.e. blocking vandals, protecting pages, restoring deleted pages etc.
* Do not post deletion requests here. Deletion requests should be made by adding '''{{tlx|delete|reason for deletion request}}''' to the top of the target page, which will then automatically mark the page as a [[:Category:Candidates for deletion|candidate for deletion]].
* Do not post issues regarding content disputes. Try making a [[Project:Community portal|request for comment]] instead.
* Mediation requests between users should only be made once a resolution could not be reached between users.
* For issues regarding the use of this wiki, please see our [[gphelp:|help center]].

In case of vandalism, posting about it here is low priority. Revert it first, anyone can do so. If the vandal created a new page, tag it for deletion. Assume good faith and consider leaving a message on that user's talk page to explain the reason. Post here only if the user has made several disruptive edits and/or persists despite a warning. Always ''avoid a revert war'' with the vandal; it is far better to wait until an admin has a chance to intervene. If a user must be reported here, please use {{tl|user}}, preferably as the topic subject/headline.

&lt;div class="plainlinks" style="text-align:center; padding: 3px; font-size:105%; font-variant: small-caps; border-radius: 4px;"&gt;'''[{{fullurle:{{SITENAME}}:Admin noticeboard|action=edit&amp;section=new}} Please post new topics at the bottom of the page by clicking this link to add a new section.]'''&lt;/div&gt;

{{Prime Punchmech}}
trying to edit the wiki and working on systems. the system detales in the template seems to be stored somewhere else because typing in (with no spaces) { { P r i m e _ P u n c h m e c h } } brings up what's above I need to edit it but don't know how. I would greatly apreciate any help

'''Result''': &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|-&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

This template is used inside other templates when a pipe symbol is required.

== Documentation ==
When combining wikitable syntax with parser functions, &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; is interpreted as a parameter separator rather than a table cell or row separator. Using &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{!-}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to begin a new table row instead is a workaround that often solves this problem.

'''Result:''' &amp;nbsp;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;

It works similarly to the HTML markup sequence: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;bull;&amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, that is, a non-breaking space, a bullet and another non-breaking space.

This template is used when you want a larger bullet than a bold middot '''&amp;middot;''', but something smaller than an en dash '''&amp;ndash;'''.

This is a meta-template for constructing standardized copyright/license notices. It automatically switches between a light-colored copyright symbol on dark-themed wikis and a dark-colored image for light-themed wikis. You can also change this template by specifying the image parameter and using a custom image rather than the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div class="copyright-icon"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

==Usage==
&lt;pre&gt;
{{copyrightbox
|text = Example text.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Usage==
Usage is {{tlx|DisambigMsg|''what this article is about''|''what other article 1 is about''|''name of other article 1''|''what other article 2 is about''|''name of other article 2''|...)}}.  You can provide up to three pairs of "other article" parameters as you want (minimum one, of course).  

For example, {{tlx|DisambigMsg|the quest Test|the Achievement |Test (achievement)}} will result in:
{| style="padding-bottom:5px;padding-left:25px"
|{{DisambigMsg|the quest Test|the Achievement |Test (achievement)}}
|}
{{tlx|DisambigMsg|the quest Test|the class|Test (class)|the achievement|Test (achievement)}} will result in:
{| style="padding-bottom:5px;padding-left:25px"
|{{DisambigMsg|the quest Test|the class|Test (class)|the achievement|Test (achievement)}}
|}

To use, create a sub-page from the template called '''doc''', put {{tl|doc/start}} at the start of your documentation, and {{tl|doc/end}} at the end.

Go back to your main template page and put &amp;lt;noinclude&amp;gt;{{tl|doc}}&amp;lt;/noinclude&amp;gt; on a newline after the end of the template. /doc pages will automatically be added to [[:Category:Documentation templates]].

== Optional parameters ==
=== clear ===
If your main template page has floating content and you would like to stop it going over the documentation, put {{tlx|doc/start|clear}} instead of {{tl|doc/start}} on your documentation page.&lt;br&gt;
This is also useful for templates not using &amp;lt;includeonly&amp;gt;, as it will put some space between the template and the documentation box.

=== nodoc=1 ===
If a template has no documentation and you don't know how to use it, put {{tlx|doc/start|nodoc{{=}}1}} (or if the template needs clear as well, {{tlx|doc/start|clear|nodoc{{=}}1}}) instead of {{tl|doc/start}} on your documentation page.&lt;br&gt;
The documentation's background will become red to make it more noticeable, and the page will be added to [[:Category:Templates with no documentation]].

=== baddoc=1 ===
Similar to nodoc, this is used to mark templates that '''do''' have documentation, but it isn't very good. This can mean it doesn't have enough examples, doesn't explain all the functions properly, or doesn't explain the point of the template properly.&lt;br&gt;
The documentation's background will become yellow to make it more noticeable, and the page will be added to [[:Category:Templates with bad documentation]].

If both nodoc and baddoc are specified, baddoc will be ignored.
&lt;/div&gt;

This template creates a main page icon with a text link underneath. As the page width narrows, a group of these icons will rearrange themselves onto as many lines as necessary. The group can be centered by enclosing the template calls in &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;center&gt; ... &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags.

== Customization ==
* The vertical alignment can be changed from either top to bottom depending on the nature of the icons.
* The default size of the icons can be changed, or the size parameter can be set.
* The text links under the icons can be removed.

== Example ==
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

This template is for creating the styled links used within boxes on the front page: {{SITENAME}}. It relies heavily on CSS in [[MediaWiki:Hydradark.css]] and [[MediaWiki:Mobile.css]].

==Basic links==
For the most basic links, the usage is as follows for a standard wiki link:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{FP link|page name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{FP link|page name|link text}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

For external links, the usage is:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{FP link|url=http://www.example.com}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{FP link|url=http://www.example.com|link text}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

{{featured images}}

== Using this template ==
This template uses the [[gphelp:Extension:SlideBoxLightShow|SlideBoxLightShow]] extension to display a slideshow featuring some image (9 in this case, though the number can be much greater). The slideshow itself will be centered with respect to the section in which it is placed on the page. All the images included in the slideshow are centered with respect to each other and are scaled to a maximum width of 250px and/or a maximum height of 150px, whichever is smaller.

This template could also include a mobile view alternative which used smaller, more mobile friendly dimensions.

Follow the extension link for further information.

This template can be used to output the full wiki URL e.g. (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://help.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) in plaintext or within a plainlink span using the fullurl magic word.

This template is useful for actions, for example action=edit to link to the edit box.

== Usage ==
To use this template you put the name of the page you want and any actions you want to perform (anything that is after an &amp;amp;).

=== Examples ===
&lt;pre&gt;{{fullurl|Blocks|action=edit}}&lt;/pre&gt;
Will output: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;//help.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Blocks&amp;action=edit&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;{{fullurl|Blocks|action=edit|nolink=1}}&lt;/pre&gt;
Will output: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://help.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Blocks&amp;action=edit&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;{{fullurl|Blocks|action=edit|text=Edit page}}&lt;/pre&gt;
Will output: &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://help.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Blocks&amp;action=edit Edit page]&lt;/span&gt;

=== Notes ===
* All url parameters are kept within the same parameter. (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{fullurl|MediaWiki:Common.css|action=raw&amp;ctype=text/css}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{fullurl|MediaWiki:Common.css|action=raw|ctype=text/css}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;)

== Usage ==
This template is used in the [[:Category:Legal notices|Legal notices]]. It takes the wiki &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{SITENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; magic word and strips out the word "Wiki" leaving just the game name. In most instances this works perfectly. However, if your wiki's name doesn't match up with the game name, simply change this template to insert the text and/or links you want.

Using {{tl|Hatnote|''text''}} formats text into the standard stylistic for a wiki hatnote. That produces a short note placed at the top of an article to provide disambiguation of closely related terms or summarise a topic, explaining its boundaries.

==Function==
This template is primarily used to add a correctly formatted ''hatnote'' to a page. Often, but not always, this is a ''disambiguation link'' at the top of article pages. It places an HTML &lt;code&gt;div-&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; block around the text entered as its only argument, which provides standardized formatting (contents are indented and italicized in most displays); it also isolates the contained code to make sure that it is interpreted correctly.

This template is also used as the "meta-template" for additional specialized disambiguation link templates.

The template does not automatically create links of any kind. Links and other desired formatting must be explicitly added, using normal wiki markup.

A template for passives, weapons, and everything else!
==Usage==
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Mech system
|name          =
|image         =
|class         =
|preview       =
|effect        =
|effect damage =

|upgrade1 cost =
|upgrade1 desc =   
|upgrade2      =
|upgrade2 cost =
|upgrade2 desc =   
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
===Example===
The following is an example with the Titan Fist weapon's stats, before the Advanced Edition update:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Mech system
|name          =Titan Fist
|image         =prime_punchmech.png
|class         =Prime
|preview       =[[File:Titan Fist Preview.gif|thumb]]
|effect        =Punch an adjacent tile, damaging and pushing it.
|effect cost   ={{Template:1power}}
|effect damage =2
|upgrade1      =Dash
|upgrade1 cost ={{Template:2power}}
|upgrade1 desc =Charge any distance before punching the target.
|upgrade2      =+2 Damage
|upgrade2 cost ={{Template:3power}}
|upgrade2 desc =Increases damage by 2.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The above example results in:
{{Mech system
|name          =Titan Fist
|image         =prime_punchmech.png
|class         =Prime
|preview       =[[File:Titan Fist Preview.gif|thumb]]
|effect        =Punch an adjacent tile, damaging and pushing it.
|effect cost   ={{Template:1power}}
|effect damage =2
|upgrade1      =Dash
|upgrade1 cost ={{Template:2power}}
|upgrade1 desc =Charge any distance before punching the target.
|upgrade2      =+2 Damage
|upgrade2 cost ={{Template:3power}}
|upgrade2 desc =Increases damage by 2.

This template is used to suggest that a page should be moved (renamed) to a different title. Since there are no special rights required for page moves, this should be used only when a page move should be discussed first.

The exception is images, which do require special rights for moves. This can be used on image pages even for routine moves.

This template will add tagged pages to [[:Category:Pages to be moved]].

==Usage==
{{tlx|move|new title|reason}}

Replace "new title" above with the suggested title for the page, and replace "reason" with a short description of the reason for doing so. The reason is technically optional, but omitting it is discouraged.

== Usage ==
Please remove the parameters that are left blank.

&lt;pre style="overflow: auto;"&gt;{{Navbox
| name       = {{subst:PAGENAME}}{{subst:void|Don't change anything on this line. It will change itself when you save.}}
| title      =

&lt;!-- ... --&gt;
| group20    =
| list20     =

| below      =
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Parameter list ==
{{Navbox
| name   = Navbox/doc
| state  = uncollapsed
| title  = {{{title}}}
| above  = {{{above}}}
| image  = {{{image}}}
| group1 = {{{group1}}}
| list1  = {{{list1}}}
| group2 = {{{group2}}}

| group4 = {{{group4}}}
| list4  = {{{list4}}}
| below  = {{{below}}}
}}

The navbox uses lowercase parameter names, as shown in the box (''above''). The required ''name'' and ''title'' will create a one-line box if other parameters are omitted.

Notice "group1" (etc.) is optional, as are sections named "above/below".
{{clear}}
The basic and most common parameters are as follows (see [[#Parameter descriptions|below]] for the full list):

: &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; – the name of the template.
: &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; – text in the title bar, such as: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Widget stuff]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
: &lt;code&gt;listclass&lt;/code&gt; – a CSS class for the list cells, usually &lt;code&gt;hlist&lt;/code&gt; for horizontal lists. Alternatively, use bodyclass for the whole box.
: &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; – controls when a navbox is expanded or collapsed.
: &lt;code&gt;titlestyle&lt;/code&gt; – a CSS style for the title-bar, such as: &lt;code&gt;background: gray;&lt;/code&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;groupstyle&lt;/code&gt; – a CSS style for the group-cells, such as: &lt;code&gt;background: #eee;&lt;/code&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;above&lt;/code&gt; – text to appear above the group/list section (could be a list of overall wikilinks).
: &lt;code&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; – an optional right-side image, coded as the whole image. Typically it is purely decorative, so it should be coded as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;XX&lt;/var&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;.jpg|80px|link=|alt=]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
: &lt;code&gt;imageleft&lt;/code&gt; – an optional left-side image (code the same as the "image" parameter).
: &lt;code&gt;group&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; – the left-side text before list-n (if group-n omitted, list-n starts at left of box).
: &lt;code&gt;list&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; – text listing wikilinks using a [[wikipedia:Help:Lists|wikilist]] format.
: &lt;code&gt;below&lt;/code&gt; – optional text to appear below the group/list section.

== Parameter descriptions ==
The following is a complete list of parameters for using {{tl|Navbox}}.  In most cases, the only required parameters are &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;list1&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Setup parameters ===
:; ''name''
:: The name of the template, which is needed for the "V&amp;nbsp;• T&amp;nbsp;• E" ("View&amp;nbsp;• Talk&amp;nbsp;• Edit") links to work properly on all pages where the template is used. You can enter &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; for this value as a shortcut.  The name parameter is only mandatory if a &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; is specified, and the &lt;code&gt;border&lt;/code&gt; parameter is not set, and the &lt;code&gt;navbar&lt;/code&gt; parameter is not used to disable the navbar.
:; ''state'' &lt;span style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;[&lt;code&gt;autocollapse, collapsed, expanded, plain, off&lt;/code&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
:* Defaults to &lt;code&gt;autocollapse&lt;/code&gt;. A navbox with &lt;code&gt;autocollapse&lt;/code&gt; will start out collapsed if there are two or more tables on the same page that use other collapsible tables. Otherwise, the navbox will be expanded. For the technically minded, see [[MediaWiki:Hydradark.js]].
:* If set to &lt;code&gt;collapsed&lt;/code&gt;, the navbox will always start out in a collapsed state.
:* If set to &lt;code&gt;expanded&lt;/code&gt;, the navbox will always start out in an expanded state.
:* If set to &lt;code&gt;plain&lt;/code&gt;, the navbox will always be expanded with no [hide] link on the right, and the title will remain centered (by using padding to offset the &lt;small&gt;V&amp;nbsp;• T&amp;nbsp;• E&lt;/small&gt; links).
:* If set to &lt;code&gt;off&lt;/code&gt;, the navbox will always be expanded with no [hide] link on the right, but no padding will be used to keep the title centered.  This is for advanced use only; the "plain" option should suffice for most applications where the [show]/[hide] button needs to be hidden.
: To show the box when standalone (non-included) but then auto-hide contents when in an article, put "expanded" inside &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;noinclude|&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/noinclude|&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags. This setting will force the box visible when standalone (even when followed by other boxes), displaying "[hide]", but then it will auto-collapse the box when stacked inside an article:
:: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;| state =&amp;nbsp;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;noinclude|&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;expanded&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/noinclude|&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
: Often times, editors will want a default initial state for a navbox, which may be overridden in an article. Here is the trick to do this:
:* In your intermediate template, create a parameter also named "state" as a pass-through like this:
:: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;| state = {{{state&lt;includeonly&gt;|your_desired_initial_state&lt;/includeonly&gt;}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:* The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;includeonly&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; will make the template expanded when viewing the template page by itself.
:; ''navbar''
:: If set to &lt;code&gt;plain&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;span style="font-size: 88%;"&gt;V&amp;nbsp;• T&amp;nbsp;• E&lt;/span&gt; links on the left side of the titlebar will not be displayed, and padding will be automatically used to keep the title centered.  Use &lt;code&gt;off&lt;/code&gt; to remove the &lt;span style="font-size: 88%;"&gt;V&amp;nbsp;• T&amp;nbsp;• E&lt;/span&gt; links, but not apply padding (this is for advanced use only; the "plain" option should suffice for most applications where a navbar is not desired). It is highly recommended that one not hide the navbar, in order to make it easier for users to edit the template, and to keep a standard style across pages.

== Usage ==
Edit this template to replace the name of the game publisher in all the [[:Category:Legal notices|Legal notices]]. If you wish to also link to the publishers site, you can specify the site url as follows:

:{{Tlx|Publisher|http://subsetgames.com}}

Result:
:{{Publisher|http://subsetgames.com}}

Alternatively, you can simply remove the logic and hardcode the url in the template, rather than using the unnamed variable: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This will link to the publisher's site in all instances, rather than optionally.

This template is added at the top of image pages to mark images that need improved versions, such as a file that was uploaded only a placeholder or is of poor quality.

Don't be afraid to remove these notices after uploading the file. Leaving these notices behind after addressing the problem is confusing to other wiki users.

Any pages using this template will be automatically placed in the [[:Category:Images needing improvement|Images needing improvement]] category.

This template trims whitespace from the beginning and end of the supplied value. It works by using the simple hack of filtering it through the &lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt; parser function.

Usage:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{trim|  value }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

== Using this template ==
This template, with the options as they are currently set, will display a twitter feed which is centered with respect to the section of the page where it is placed. It uses the background colour of the wiki and does not display the twitter feed footer.

For more specific information on the Curse twitter extension, see [[gphelp:Extension:Curse_Twitter|Help wiki page]].

=== Example for a dark-themed wiki ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;twitterfeed nobackground nofooter theme="dark" linkcolor="#3674b3"&gt;cursegamepedia&lt;/twitterfeed&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Example for a light-themed wiki ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;twitterfeed nobackground nofooter theme="light" linkcolor="#3674b3"&gt;cursegamepedia&lt;/twitterfeed&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
